# Building scratchy

How to build `scratchy-cli` (binary `scr`) — backend selection, and the
`-Fmodel/`/`-Fquant/` feature landscape that scopes which models and
quantization variants actually compile in. For adding a *new* model
architecture (DSL carrier, `configs/`, weight shapes), see
[`MODELS.md`](MODELS.md) instead — this doc is about building what already
exists, not adding to it.

## Quickstart

```bash
cargo build -p scratchy-cli --release --features metal,model/llama-3.2-3b
```

`cuda` and `metal` are mutually exclusive. **On cuda this one-liner is not
enough** — the kernels are a separate cargo invocation that has to run first;
see [CUDA: build the kernels first](#cuda-build-the-kernels-first). Add
`serve` for the HTTP server
(`chat` — the in-process engine — is on by default), `multimodal` for the
image-decode stack, `bench` for `scr bench serve`. Tab completion over real
HuggingFace model ids is on by default (`hf-completions`); pass
`--no-default-features` to build with no network access at all. TurboQuant KV
compression is on with `metal` (and off for cuda and spyre), fixed at build time — see
[`turboquant`](#turboquant--kv-cache-compression-fixed-at-build-time).

## CUDA: build the kernels first

A cuda build is **two cargo invocations, in this order**:

```bash
export SCRATCHY_GPU=h100 CUDA_ARCH=90 CUDA_COMPUTE_CAP=90   # see the table below

# 1. nvcc kernels -> .a files in ~/.cache/cudaforge/scratchy-serving-cuda/
#    No model or quant scope: nothing in forward expansion emits .cu, so the
#    kernel set is scope-independent. Tens of minutes, several GB of RAM.
cargo build --release -p scratchy-builder-cuda --features cuda

# 2. the binary, which links those .a files
cargo build --release -p scratchy-cli \
    --features cuda,serve,bench,model/qwen2.5-14b,quant/fp8-dynamic-per-tensor
```

Step 1 cannot be folded into step 2. `scratchy-target-cuda`'s `build.rs` emits
`rustc-link-lib=static=` for eleven archives that `scratchy-builder-cuda`'s
`build.rs` produces, and rustc *bundles* static natives into an rlib — so those
`.a` files must already exist when the rlib is built. There is no Cargo edge to
order that: `scratchy-models` depends on `scratchy-target-cuda`, so an edge back
from `target-cuda` to the builder would cycle. Skipping step 1 fails with
`could not find native static library`, and it fails nondeterministically —
whichever archive rustc reaches first.

Three environment variables, none of them optional on a build host without a
GPU:

| var | read by | if unset |
|---|---|---|
| `SCRATCHY_GPU` | `#[forward]`, at expansion | probes `nvidia-smi`, else build error listing valid values |
| `CUDA_ARCH` | kernel build + FA3 gating + the FA3 link | probes `nvidia-smi`, else **defaults to 89 and silently drops FlashAttention-3** |
| `CUDA_COMPUTE_CAP` | `cudarc`'s build script | probes the local GPU |

`CUDA_ARCH` is the one that bites: unset on a GPU-less builder it yields a
binary that links and runs on Hopper with no FA3 decode path and no warning.
Set it explicitly whenever you are not building on the target GPU.

`git` must be on `PATH` at build time — `cudaforge` clones NVIDIA/cutlass at a
pinned commit while compiling the scaled_mm kernels.

`SCRATCHY_SKIP_CUDA_KERNELS=1` skips step 1's nvcc work for `cargo
check`/`clippy` (this is what CI's cuda gate sets). Never set it for anything
that links a binary.

## There is no default model, quant or drafter scope

`scratchy-models`, `scratchy-quantizations` and `scratchy-spec` all ship
`default = []`.
Naming zero models is a **build-time panic**, not a silently-empty binary —
`scratchy-forwards.rs` checks `total_models_emitted()` after every arch is
processed and fails loudly, telling you to name at least one. This means
every build — dev, CI, or deployment — names its own scope explicitly; there
is no `--no-default-features` dance to first strip away a default you don't
want.

## Model, quant and drafter scope: three crates, three CLI aliases

Model *scope* (`crates/models/arch/`, crate `scratchy-models`) and quant
*scope* (`crates/models/quantization/`, crate `scratchy-quantizations`) are
Cargo features on two **different** crates — not because picking a model and
picking a quantization are conceptually different (both are just "pick a
JSON file by name": model configs from `configs/<arch>/*.json`, quant
presets from `quantization/presets/*.json`), but because **Cargo forbids
aliasing one crate under two different local names**, and
`crates/cli/scr/Cargo.toml` needs two distinct short aliases reachable from
the CLI build line: `model` and `quant`. Speculative-decoding drafters are a
third alias, `spec`, on a third crate (`crates/models/spec/`, crate
`scratchy-spec`) for the same reason; its features forward to
`scratchy-models`, whose build script compiles the drafters.

```toml
# crates/cli/scr/Cargo.toml
model = { package = "scratchy-models", ... }
spec = { package = "scratchy-spec", ... }
quant = { package = "scratchy-quantizations", ... }
```

Cargo's `pkg/feature` CLI syntax resolves against these local names and
activates the (optional) dependency itself, so every feature below is
reachable directly from `scr`'s own build line as `model/<feature>` or
`quant/<feature>` — no hand-maintained passthrough feature list to keep in
sync (a guard test, `crates/cli/scr/tests/arch_feature_passthrough.rs`,
fails loudly if one ever creeps back in).

## `-Fmodel/<...>` — which models compile in

One Cargo feature per checked-in `configs/<arch>/<stem>.json`, named
`<stem>` — no `model-` text prefix; the `model` alias already says that.

```bash
cargo build -p scratchy-cli --features metal,model/qwen2.5-7b
```

- **`model/<stem>`** — exactly one model + variant, e.g.
  `model/granite-3.1-2b-instruct`. Disabled means the file is never even
  opened (the gate runs on the filename alone, before the JSON is parsed),
  so this is both the selection mechanism and a compile-time win — an
  unselected model costs nothing, not even a parse.
- **`model/<arch>`** — every config in one arch, e.g. `model/granite` is
  shorthand for "all granite models".
- **`model/all`** — every checked-in config, every arch. This is CI's
  full-scope case: slow (minutes) and RAM-heavy. Don't reach for it to test
  one thing.
- A handful of stems are byte-identical files checked into two arch dirs at
  once (the same checkpoint, loadable via a vision arch or its non-vision
  base arch — e.g. `gemma-3-12b-it` under both `gemma3/` and `gemma3-mm/`).
  The vision arch keeps the bare stem; the base arch's copy is
  `<stem>-text-only`.

`arch-<name>` (which architecture's Rust module + DSL carrier compiles at
all) is implied automatically by any of that arch's `<stem>` features — you
essentially never name it directly.

## `-Fquant/<...>` — which quantization a model compiles as

One Cargo feature per preset, named `<preset>` — no `quant-` text prefix,
same reasoning as `<stem>`.

```bash
cargo build -p scratchy-cli --features metal,model/granite-3.1-2b-instruct,quant/mlx
# → granite-3.1-2b-instruct compiles as its MLX affine variants, not dense
```

**A selected quant preset REPLACES a model's dense/bf16 emission — it does
not add to it.** If any preset both survives Cargo-feature scoping and is
claimable on the active backend (metal only claims `mlx-affine-*`/`nvfp4`;
cuda is the mirror — see `quant_preset_active` in
`crates/compiler/macros/src/config.rs`), every selected model in that arch
gets its quant variant(s) *instead of* dense. A preset that wouldn't
actually synthesize on the active backend can never suppress dense, so a
model never ends up with zero compiled variants.

- **`quant/<preset>`** — one specific preset, e.g. `quant/fp8-dynamic-per-channel`.
- **`quant/mlx`** — shorthand for every MLX affine (int4) preset at once —
  the dominant use case on metal, but still opt-in (neither `metal` nor
  `cuda` defaults any preset on; a default-on preset would silently kill
  dense on every build using that backend).

No `quant/*` feature named at all = every selected model compiles dense only.

## `-Fspec/<...>` — which drafters compile with the selected models

```bash
cargo build -p scratchy-cli --features metal,serve,model/qwen3.6-35b-a3b,spec/mtp,quant/mlx-affine-b4-g64-qembed
# → Qwen3.6-35B-A3B plus its multi-token-prediction head; serving it drafts with the head
```

- **`spec/mtp`** — every selected model whose checkpoint carries a
  multi-token-prediction head compiles that head too. A head's config is its
  target's checkpoint config verbatim, so a head config is selected when it is
  the same file as a selected model's config (`target_selected` in
  `crates/compiler/macros/src/config.rs`); naming the head's own stem
  (`model/qwen3.6-35b-a3b-mtp`) still works.

No `spec/*` feature named = no drafter compiles, and the selected models serve
without speculative decoding.

## `turboquant` — KV cache compression, fixed at build time

On metal, a model's KV cache is either dense (the model's own dtype) or
TurboQuant codes (3-bit for the Llama family, 4-bit otherwise), and the build
decides which: nothing chooses at runtime. `scratchy-cli`'s `metal` feature
turns `turboquant` **on**; a cuda or spyre build does not have it.

With it on, every selected model whose geometry the codec takes is emitted with
`KV_CODEC = TurboQuant`; the rest stay dense and the build names each one and
why:

```
warning: scratchy-models@0.1.0: turboquant: qwen2.5-0.5b keeps a dense KV cache: its KV row is 12 KiB/token, below the 24 KiB TurboQuant threshold
```

A model stays dense when it has no KV cache, when its KV cache is an MLA
latent, when a head_dim is not a power of two no wider than 512, or when its
fp16 KV row is under 24 KiB/token — too small for the capacity to be worth the
fidelity. The rule is `scratchy_layers::turboquant::codec_for`. The
server logs the loaded model's codec at start (`KV cache codec: TurboQuant
3-bit (built in)`).

`--kv-cache-dtype` on metal takes the codec by default (`auto`) and can only
*assert* it: `fp16` or `turboquant` refuses to start if the binary stores the
model's KV cache the other way.

## `hf-completions` — shell tab completion over real model ids

`scr completions bash` / `scr completions zsh` print a completion script for
this binary. Install it once, either by hand:

```bash
scr completions zsh  > ~/.zsh/completions/_scr        # dir must be on $fpath
scr completions bash > /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d/scr
```

or let `scr` do it — `--install` writes the script to the standard per-shell
location AND wires up the shell rc file so it actually loads:

```bash
scr completions bash --install   # writes ~/.local/share/scr/completions.bash,
                                  # sources it from ~/.bashrc
scr completions zsh  --install   # writes ~/.zsh/completions/_scr,
                                  # adds it to $fpath in ~/.zshrc
```

`--install` is idempotent (marked block, safe to re-run after a rebuild) and
never clobbers the rest of the rc file. For zsh specifically, it inserts the
`fpath` entry *before* the first existing `compinit` call rather than
appending — zsh's completion system only picks up an autoloadable `#compdef`
function from a directory that was already on `$fpath` when `compinit` ran, so
appending after an existing `compinit` call would silently install a script
that never actually completes anything. If no `compinit` call exists yet,
`--install` adds one.

Subcommands, flags and enum values in that script come from the binary's own
clap command tree, so they always match the feature set it was built with —
a `chat`-only build never offers `serve`. Re-run `--install` (or regenerate by
hand) after rebuilding with different features.

**Model names come from `hf-completions`, which is on by default.** The build
asks huggingface.co which repos carry each compiled arch's family
tag, then fetches each candidate's `config.json` and keeps only those whose
shape (`hidden_size`, `num_hidden_layers`, expert count) matches a compiled
config AND whose `quantization_config` matches a compiled quant preset. So the
completions obey `-Fmodel/<stem>` and `-Fquant/<preset>` exactly: an
`mlx-affine-b4-g64` build completes 4-bit g64 MLX repos and not their 8-bit
siblings, and a dense build completes only unquantized repos. The result is
baked into the binary as a `&'static [&'static str]` — **tab completion itself
never touches the network.**

```bash
cargo build -p scratchy-cli --features metal,model/llama-3.2-1b
scr model names --source compiled      # what this build resolved to
```

- **On by default, opt out for an air-gapped build.** Verifying candidates
  costs one HTTP request each — ~160 for a single small arch, and hundreds per
  arch at `model/all` scope, which a clean build pays in full. To make no
  network requests at all, drop the feature:

  ```bash
  cargo build -p scratchy-cli --no-default-features \
      --features chat,metal,model/llama-3.2-1b
  ```

  `ureq` is then not even linked into the build script, so the build cannot
  reach the Hub by accident. The feature rides `scratchy-cli`'s default
  features via a weak `model?/hf-completions` edge, so it activates only when
  a `-Fmodel/<stem>` is named; building `-p scratchy-models` directly does not
  turn it on (its own `default` stays empty, which is what keeps CI's
  `--workspace` and `metal,all` runs network-free).
- **`HF_TOKEN` at BUILD time widens the list.** Gated repos (`meta-llama/*`)
  return 401 without it and are dropped, so the same model scope resolves
  differently with and without a token.
- Results are cached under `<target-dir>/hf-registry-cache/` with a 7-day TTL,
  so repeat builds don't re-hit the Hub. `cargo clean` discards it.

**With no registry there is no model-name completion at all** — subcommands and
flags still complete, but `scr chat <TAB>` offers nothing. That is deliberate.
The obvious fallback, completing from the local hf-hub cache, is wrong: the
cache is whatever has ever been pulled on this machine, not what this binary can
run, so it offers other architectures, other sizes and other quantizations —
and being build-independent it produces the *same* list for every `-Fmodel`
scope, which reads exactly like a broken scope filter. Offering nothing is more
honest than offering ids that fail at load. Filtering the cache by compiled
arch/shape/quant would make it a valid source and is tracked in
[#26](https://github.com/AI-native-Systems-Research/scratchy/issues/26).

## Fast iteration: scope to one small model

When verifying a change, **scope the build to exactly the one model you
need** — `-Fmodel/<stem>` (e.g. `-Fmodel/llama-3.2-1b` or
`-Fmodel/smollm2-135m` for the smallest/quickest option), plus
`-Fquant/<preset>` only if the change is quant-specific:

```bash
cargo build -p scratchy-cli --features metal,model/smollm2-135m
```

**Never build `model/<arch>` or `model/all` just to test one thing** — the
`#[forward]` macro is the bulk of per-arch compile time, and forward-expanding
every config in scope (rather than the one you actually need) costs
minutes-to-hours and risks OOM on a laptop. `SCRATCHY_BUILD_FILTER=<tag>,...`
(comma-separated substrings, OR'd, matched against the stem) still exists as
an orthogonal cross-cutting filter on top of whichever `model/*` features are
enabled — useful for narrowing a wide `model/<arch>` build without listing
every excluded model individually — but for picking one specific model it's
no longer necessary; just name that model's feature directly.

## Direct crate builds

`-p scratchy-cli` reaches `scratchy-models`/`scratchy-quantizations`/`scratchy-spec`
via the `model`/`quant`/`spec` aliases. Building `-p scratchy-models` or
`-p scratchy-quantizations` directly uses their real crate names instead
(the aliases only exist on `crates/cli/scr/Cargo.toml`'s dependency edges);
`scratchy-models` names the drafters itself (`mtp`, which `spec/mtp` forwards to):

```bash
cargo build -p scratchy-models --no-default-features \
    --features cuda,llama-3.2-3b
# → only llama-3.2-3b's solver runs; its config.json is the only one
#   even read out of crates/models/arch/configs/llama/
```
