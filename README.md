# Scratchy: A Hyper-specializing Inference Stack Compiler

Fifty years of software reuse let the compiler delete and specialize,
but never **restructure**. The generality of your dependencies was your
generality, whether or not you ever wanted it.

AI knocks that wall down — not by making compilers smarter, but by
making faithful transcription cheap. When you can re-express someone's
*algorithm* inside your own structure in an afternoon instead of over
two quarters of pull requests, the unit of reuse stops being the
module. It becomes the idea. And once ideas are the unit, every project
gets to be bespoke.

**Scratchy is what that looks like for inference**: a full-stack
compiler that builds inference runtimes *from scratch* — or as close to
that as is possible. It takes as input a triple:

- a [DSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language) for
  the entire forward of a model architecture;
  e.g. [**gemma4-moe**](crates/models/arch/dsl/gemma4-moe.py)
- the config.json for a given instance of that architecture;
  e.g. [**gemma4-moe-26b-a4b-it**](crates/models/arch/configs/gemma4-moe/gemma-4-26b-a4b-it.json)
- the JSON config for a given quantization;
  e.g. [**fp8-dynamic-per-channel**](crates/models/quantization/presets/fp8-dynamic-per-channel.json)

Given that triple input, Scratchy generates an inference server
specialized for that input.  Scratchy extensively utilizes Rust's
Turing complete procedural-macros to avoid much of the complexity of
writing a compiler, to allow for rapid integration of new
architectures, and to generate faster specialized code.  In scratchy,
everything is a constant. This turns complex analysis into arithmetic,
greatly simplifying our code. It also can enable more constant-prop
optimizations, reducing register pressure in key kernels.

The whole point is that ideas are cheap to carry and generality is
not. 25 model architectures fit in 1,580 lines of DSL — LLaMA is 22 of
them — because the specializer absorbed everything that was ever
generic about them. The serving algorithms are
[vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm)'s, transcribed into Rust
and credited by file and line at each site: seventy citations to a
repository that isn't in our build graph.

Scratchy's initial design point is [IBM Spyre
AIU](https://research.ibm.com/blog/spyre-for-z) — the real test, because
novel silicon is where the library era has nothing to offer you. Each
Spyre core has a 2Mi scratchpad, of which 1,677,721 bytes are yours,
and every tile of every operation must fit. Overflow it and you don't
get an error message; you get `DtException 1535` on the card, minutes
later, about a tile you can no longer inspect. Because scratchy knows
every tile size at compile time, that fault is a `cargo build` error on
your laptop instead. CUDA and Apple Silicon are also supported, and
were the easier cases.

## Key Numbers

- Very small AoT binaries, e.g. 30Mi for Metal, 100Mi for Spyre, 250Mi for Cuda.
- Very small docker images, e.g. 330Mi for Spyre.
- Fast startup time, e.g. 300ms warm startup on Apple Silicon *independent of model size*; 12s for 8B on Spyre.
- 25 architectures in 1,580 lines of DSL; supporting Spyre took about as much Rust as supporting CUDA, and cost *zero* lines of model code.

## Getting Started

Install a recent [Rust toolchain](https://rustup.rs/). Then, pick your
target via [feature
flag](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/features.html):
`-Fcuda` requires the CUDA build toolkit; `-Fmetal` requires macOS;
`-Fspyre` requires the Spyre build toolkit.  For example, you can
compile support for Apple Silicon, the Llama 3.2 3B models, and the
MLX 4-bit quant:

```bash
cargo build -F metal,model/llama-3.2-3b,quant/mlx --release
```

By default, only the simple `scr chat` CLI command is compiled
in. Provide `-Fserve` or `-Fbench` to bring more features into the
binary. To run a quick test of the build:

```bash
./target/release/scr chat mlx-community/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct-4bit -q "why is the sky blue?"
```

Note the convention for selecting models and quants:
- `model/<stem>` — one checked-in model config, e.g. `model/qwen2.5-7b`
  (`model/<arch>` for every config in an arch, `model/all` for everything).
- `quant/<preset>` — compiles that quantization instead of dense/bf16
  (e.g. `quant/mlx` for every MLX affine int4 preset at once).
- `hf-completions` — shell tab completion over the real HuggingFace ids this
  build can actually run (`scr completions zsh --install`). **On by default**;
  it resolves that list against huggingface.co at build time, so an air-gapped
  build wants `--no-default-features`. See [`docs/BUILD.md`](docs/BUILD.md).
