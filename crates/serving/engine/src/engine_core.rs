//! Engine core loop and request lifecycle management.

//! The `EngineCore` is the central coordinator of vLLM. It sits between the
//! API server (front-end) and the model executor (back-end):
//!
//! ```text
//!   API Server  ──► EngineCore ──► Executor ──► GPU Workers
//!                    │ scheduler │
//!                    │ kv cache  │
//! ```
//!
//! Each iteration of the engine core:
//! 1. Processes pending input requests (add, abort, utility)
//! 2. Runs the scheduler to decide which requests to process
//! 3. Dispatches execution to the model executor
//! 4. Collects outputs and routes them back to clients
