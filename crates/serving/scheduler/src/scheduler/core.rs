//! Main scheduler implementation, ported from `vllm/v1/core/sched/scheduler.py`.
//!
//! The scheduler is responsible for deciding which requests to process at each
//! scheduling step and how many tokens to allocate to each request. It manages
//! the request lifecycle through waiting, running, and finished states.
//!
//! This initial Rust port simplifies the KV cache interaction by tracking a
//! simple block counter rather than full block allocation. A trait
//! [`KVCacheManagerOps`] is defined so that the real KV cache manager (built
//! by another agent) can be plugged in later.

///   allocation (`_maybe_evict_cached_block`).
/// - **`touch()`**: Increments ref_cnt. If ref_cnt was 0 (block in free queue),
///   the block is logically removed from the free queue (stale entry skipped
///   lazily).
/// - **`free_blocks()`**: Decrements ref_cnt. Blocks with ref_cnt == 0 are
///   appended to the free queue.
/// - Blocks are freed in reverse order so tail (decode) blocks are evicted
///   first and prefix blocks survive longest (matching Python's

        // The scheduling algorithm, ported from Python's Scheduler.schedule():
        //
        // 1. Schedule RUNNING requests first: assign tokens, handle preemption
        //    when blocks run out.
        // 2. Schedule WAITING requests next: compute prefix cache hits,
        //    assign tokens, allocate blocks.
        // 3. Build and return SchedulerOutput.

        // ⭐⭐⭐ THE STEP'S REACH, COMPUTED BEFORE ANYTHING IS ALLOCATED.
        //
        // A batched step appends every row at ONE KV slot, as deep as the DEEPEST live request. So a request
        // admitted later in this very function deepens the write slot of every request allocated earlier in it,
        // whose allocation was sized by a worker report made before that request existed. Both queues are
        // visible here and nothing has been allocated yet, so the maximum is exact for running requests and an
        // upper bound for waiting ones — a prompt is fixed at admission, so a waiting request cannot end up
        // deeper than its prompt.
        //
        // Over-reaching costs pages the pool was already sized for; under-reaching costs a page nobody owns.
        //
        // ⛔⛔⛔ IT IS **POST-APPEND**, AND THE FIRST VERSION WAS NOT — WHICH THE CARD CAUGHT AND FOUR KANI
        // PROOFS DID NOT. A pre-append max looks right and is not: the shared write slot ends at
        // `deepest_row_end + THAT ROW'S append`, while each request was allocated `its own end + ITS OWN
        // append`. A deep row taking a full 96-token prefill chunk beside a shallow row appending one decode
        // token leaves the shallow row exactly one page short. MEASURED on the 2b gate with the pre-append
        // version: the hole arm still fired on `hits`-off, `short`-off and `longhits`-reversed (2-3 pages
        // each) — the caching-OFF runs, where full re-prefills make those appends large, and the permuted run,
        // where a different row is deepest. So a row's depth here INCLUDES the append it is about to make.
        //
        // The append bound mirrors the loop's own cap chain below (`num_new_tokens_raw`, the long-prefill
        // threshold, `max_num_scheduled_tokens` as the ceiling on `token_budget`, and `max_model_len`), so it is
        // an upper bound on what any row can append — and every term is a property of that request alone, with
        // no dependence on the allocation order. Any excess is pages the declaration already bought.
        //
        // ⛔ `num_tokens_with_spec`, NOT `num_tokens`: a row's draft tokens are slots it appends this step, so
        // they move the shared write slot for everyone else. Equal when no draft is attached.
