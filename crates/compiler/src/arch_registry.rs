//! Cross-arch load registry: the `inventory`-driven
//! `ScratchyArchRegistration` / `try_load` seam every `#[forward] fn <arch>()`
//! registers through, plus its multimodal sibling
//! (`ScratchyMmRegistration` / `try_load_mm`).
//!
//! The per-arch loaders fill the concrete `GpuWeights<A>` weight-store, a type
//! this cfg-free crate cannot name (it has no backend allocator). The registry
//! fn-pointers therefore take the allocator-erased
//! [`scratchy_tensors::GpuWeightsHandle`]; the generic [`try_load`] /
//! [`try_load_mm`] entry points are monomorphized over the concrete
//! `GpuWeights<A>` at the worker call site (where `A` is the backend
//! allocator), build the handle, and pass it through the fn-pointer. The
//! macro-emitted closure recovers the concrete `&mut GpuWeights<A>` from the
//! handle before calling the per-variant `Weights::load`. This keeps the
//! registry — and the `#[forward]` macro's `inventory::submit!` target — free
//! of any backend coupling, so it can live below the neutral `ScratchyWeights`
//! contract the compiler owns.

// MM sibling registry names `scratchy-vision` (`MmMetadata`) + device-runtime
// types, neither available under spyre; the text-side registry below is
// allocator-generic + vision-free, so it compiles under spyre too.

// text-side `ScratchyArchRegistration` stays untouched and
// text-only arches never need to know MM exists. The gpu worker
// calls `try_load_mm` after `try_load` succeeds; an arch with
// no MM submission yields `Ok(None)` and the worker proceeds
// text-only. Phase B of the multimodal plan
// (`~/.claude/plans/distributed-mapping-map.md`) lands the
// surface; per-arch impls land in Phase D.
