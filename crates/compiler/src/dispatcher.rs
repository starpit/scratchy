//! seam every `#[forward] fn <arch>()` registers through.
//!
//! Every `#[forward]` macro invocation auto-emits an
//! `impl ScratchyWeights for Weights` + an `inventory::submit!`
//! registration, so `try_load` discovers every compiled arch
//! without a hand-written central list. Adding a new arch touches
//! only its source file plus a single `pub mod <arch>;` in the
//! calling crate's lib.rs (Rust module system requirement).
//!
//! The load / fingerprint / registry surface names only neutral types
//! (`LoadStream`, `WeightSource`) so it stays cfg-free of cuda/metal and a
//! third target (Spyre) registers through this SAME inventory registry.
//! Device-runtime forward methods (which name `GpuDevice` / `OwnedTensor`
//! / `ForwardCtx`) are internally `#[cfg(any(cuda, metal))]`-gated.

// Backend-neutral device tensor — the `forward*` trait methods return one.
// Lives in `scratchy-tensors` (the cfg-free core the compiler already deps),
// so naming it keeps the trait free of any backend crate.

// cfg-free dispatcher. The trait names these thin pointer newtypes instead
// (the same neutralization `LoadStream` applies to the load stream); the
