//! The canonical wavefront **SubtileIR** — region-granular SSA over
//! tensors, the fold of `region.rs` (v2) + `subtile.rs` (v1) into one
//! module.
//!
//! ## What this is
//!
//! Every value lives in a **tensor** (a logical row-major buffer): leaf
//! `sources` (weights / activations / prefix-KV / embed / cos-sin) and one
//! **op-output tensor** per op. A [`SubtileNode`] *writes a region* of
//! one output tensor and *reads regions* of input tensors. Dependencies
//! are derived from **region overlap**: a node that reads region `R` of
//! an op-output tensor `T` depends on every earlier node whose
//! write-region on `T` overlaps `R`. Reads of a leaf source have no
//! dependency (sources are bound at eval time).
//!
//! That is the SSA model that supports **true subtile granularity** on
//! the GPU: `q_proj` split into N-blocks where each block writes a slice
//! of Q, then rope → attention reads the *whole* Q assembled from those
//! slices. The v1 whole-output `Operand::Sub` model couldn't express
//! that — and is gone (it lives only in [`legacy`] for the few v1-only
//! carcasses that have not been deleted yet: [`crate::tape`],
//! [`crate::scheduler`], [`crate::lower::lower`] which are slated for
//! deletion in later staged commits).
//!
//! ## Two-tier validation
//!
//! - **Tier A′ (decomposition equivalence):** [`eval_dag`] equals
//!   `cpu_golden` whole-op output. Bit-exact at `nb >= n` and at every
//!   N-block width that doesn't reorder a per-output reduction; only
//!   token-exact once a reduction is reassociated (split-K).
//! - **Tier A (self-consistency):** scheduled tape replay equals
//!   [`eval_dag`] (lands with the wavefront scheduler).
//!
//! `cpu_golden` (in `scratchy-forward-compiler`) is the deterministic f32 substrate
//! the player computes with — not the correctness *oracle* (that is
//! scratchy-target-metal non-mega at temp=0).
