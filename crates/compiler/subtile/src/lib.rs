//! scratchy-subtile — the subtile-wavefront scheduling layer.
//!
//! This is a normal library crate (not the proc-macro), so it is
//! unit-testable on any host — the host-first correctness path runs
//! here. The proc-macro crate `scratchy-forward-compiler-macro` depends on this
//! crate and, at expansion time, walks its (internal) solved FUF and
//! calls the lowering here to build a [`subtile::SubtileGraph`], then
//! emits GPU tape players. This mirrors how `scratchy-forward-compiler-macro`
//! already runs its own FUF (fusion-synthesis) logic; the subtile IR and
//! `Fuf`/`Assignment` can't live in the
//! proc-macro crate because proc-macro crates export only macros.
//!
//! `cpu_golden` (from `scratchy-forward-compiler`) is the host *calculator* the
//! validation computes with — not the correctness *oracle* (that is
//! scratchy-target-metal non-mega at temp=0).

// First, so the pattern it generates (`expansion_ops!`) is in textual scope for every module.

// target crate.
//
// ⭐ IT NOW LIVES IN `ktir-superdsc`, RE-EXPORTED HERE SO EVERY EXISTING PATH KEEPS RESOLVING.
// The `ktir -> superdsc` lowering is being extracted into a leaf crate a third-party KTIR producer
// can consume without scratchy, and the typed SuperDSC IR was the first thing to move.
// `scratchy_subtile::superdsc_opspec::…` / `…::superdsc_error::…` — and the
// in-crate `crate::superdsc_opspec::…` that `sdsc_abstract` and `addr` use — all resolve through
// these two re-exports, so nothing else in the tree changed. Inverting the edge and deleting these
// re-exports is the last step, and it has not been taken.
//
// ⭐ `sdsc_abstract` AND `addr` FOLLOWED — the typed device facts, and the `addr` build-time
// address interpreter that PROVES the emitted SDSC attention computes the SubtileIR math
// (`softmax(q·kᵀ·scale+mask)·v`) over the real device addresses, so a translation bug is a
// `cargo build` panic rather than an on-card discovery. Those two are MUTUALLY RECURSIVE
// (`sdsc_abstract` names 66 `addr` paths; `addr` names `ElementArrangement`/`SpyreTensorLayout`/
// `MaskCorner`/`PrefixMaskShape`/`OperandPlacement`), so they are one unit and moved together.
// `model_geometry` and `subtile_ir` still name them and now reach them through this re-export;
// the metal path reads `sdsc_abstract` through `model_geometry` exactly as before.

// ⛔ UNGATED, AND THAT IS THE POINT. The re-roll machinery (`reroll_subtile_tape` /

// SuperDSC emitter (which re-rolls the layer loop so dxp compiles ONE small body
// bundle instead of the 30×-unrolled monster) and metal both lower from it. Gating it
// on a target-only feature made it INVISIBLE to a metal build, which is a large part
// of why metal forked upstream of it instead. Its non-test code depends only on
// `subtile_ir`, which is always compiled, so carrying it unconditionally pulls in no
// target-only modules.
