//! Linear, target-agnostic **SubtileTape** — a topological linearization
//! of the [`crate::subtile_ir::SubtileIR`] DAG **with every dataflow
//! edge made explicit as a slot-lifecycle instruction**.
//!
//! ## What this is (and is not)
//!
//! SubtileTape is the sequential semantics: the order in which a
//! conceptual single thread would execute the DAG, with explicit
//! `OpenLoop` / `CloseLoop` brackets for runtime-bounded loops (the
//! `AttnDecode` KV-sweep being the only such loop today).
//!
//! Every cross-Compute hazard (RAW from region overlap on op-output
//! tensors) surfaces as a **slot lifecycle**:
//!
//! ```text
//!   SlotHandle  (allocated, unwritten) ─compute_to─▶  SlotWritten (readers OK)
//!                                                         │
//!                                                   free_slot consumes
//!                                                         ▼
//!                                                       freed (id back in pool)
//! ```
//!
//! - `SlotHandle` is move-only (non-`Copy`, non-`Clone`). The Compute
//!   that writes a slot **consumes** the `SlotHandle`. Writing the same
//!   slot twice is a compile error.
//! - `SlotWritten` is move-only. Readers borrow it (`&SlotWritten`,
//!   multi-read OK). `free_slot` consumes the `SlotWritten`. Reading
//!   after free is a compile error.
//! - `compute_to` takes `&[&SlotWritten]` for reads; **reading a slot
//!   before it was written is a compile error.**
//! - `SlotId` / `SlotHandle` / `SlotWritten` are sealed — only path is
//!   the builder.
//!
//! Slot count, slot lifetime, and slot-write proof are target-agnostic
//! (a function of the DAG's liveness analysis, not the target). Only
//! **slot-physical-realization** (memory-tier capacity per slot, the
//! sync primitive that discharges the hazard) is target-specific —
//! that lives at TkTape.
//!
//! ## What does NOT live here
//!
//! All target-specific concepts
//! (execution-unit abstractions, memory-tier classification,
//! visibility primitives, pipeline-state tracking) belong on TkTape.
//! The IR-level witnesses (`KvCacheLayout`, `KvCacheProducer`,
//! `RopeForm`, online-softmax state) live on the SubtileIR `SubOp`
//! variants; the lowering looks them up by `SubtileId`.
//!
//! Plan §5 K2 is mechanically grep-checkable against this file: a
//! grep for any of the forbidden target-specific tokens must return
//! zero hits.
//!
//! For the canonical exclusion list see [`crate::subtile_ir`]. A
//! target-agnostic SubtileTape, mechanically grep-checkable, is the
//! kill criterion this module enforces.
