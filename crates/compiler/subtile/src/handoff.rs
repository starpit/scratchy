//! THE COMPILER -> TARGET HANDOFF TYPES.
//!
//! ⭐ THESE LIVE HERE SO A TARGET'S COMPILER CAN NAME THEM. They were in
//! `scratchy-forward-compiler-macro`, which DEPENDS ON the target crates — so nothing on the
//! target side could refer to them, and any lowering that needed them was forced to live in the
//! shared compiler crate no matter whose logic it was. That dependency direction is the reason
//! metal's lowering sat in `compiler/macros` instead of under `targets/metal`.
//!
//! None of it is target-specific: a `TileId` names a FUF tile, a `SlotMap` is a coloring keyed
//! on one, a `SourceBinding` says what a graph source is bound to, and a `LoweredDecode` is the
//! op list plus the provenance a target needs to bind weights to it.
//!
//! ⛔ NO `syn` HERE. `WeightSlot` stayed behind precisely because its `base` is a `syn::Ident`,
//! and this crate is compiled into the metal RUNTIME. A target lowering hands back
//! `(WeightKind, String)` and the macro crate mints the `Ident`.
