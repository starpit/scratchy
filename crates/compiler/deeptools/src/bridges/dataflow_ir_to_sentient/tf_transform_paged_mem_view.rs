//
// 1. THE AUTHORITY IS THE C++ TREE, NOT THE EXTRACT.
//       /Users/nickm/git/deeptools-src/<file>:<line>        (deeptools @ a0d29abbed — repo_info.txt)
//    That is the revision every citation below resolves against. `crustify-bridge2/source/bridge2.cpp`
//    says WHICH functions are in scope and IN WHAT ORDER; ⛔ its bodies are TRUNCATED AT THE TAIL —
//    366 of the 384 end in a blank line and bare closing braces, and a 48-entry sample against the
//    authority found 21 that had lost real trailing statements (a `return success();`, a
//    `return rhs;`, an entire `} else { … }` branch, an `initMASData(...)` call). Port from the
//    authority file at the cited line. ⛔ /Users/nickm/git/deeptools is a DIFFERENT revision.
//    ⛔ The pod (/project_src/deeptools) is NOT reachable from this host — use the mirror above.
//
// 2. PORTED MEANS THE WHOLE FUNCTION INCLUDING ITS EMISSION. The op a function emits IS the
//    function — its exact attribute names and values, branch order and early returns. A documented
//    predicate that emits nothing is NOT a port (that is how the previous attempt failed). What you
//    MAY drop is only the mechanism for REACHING operands: use-walks, memoising by
//    (core, corelet, component), positioning an OpBuilder. If the target IR cannot express a
//    function's input, ADD THE OP to `src/islands/{sentient,dataflow_ir}/` — never decide the
//    function is unnecessary.
//
// 3. THIS IS A PURE-LOGIC PORT WITH NO C ANYWHERE. Whatever the generic C-to-Rust conventions say:
//    ❌ no bindgen/allowlist/-sys, ❌ no `ffi::`/`mod ffi_export`/`#[unsafe(no_mangle)] extern "C"`,
//    ❌ no `CRUSTIFY_<FILE>` switch, ❌ no `Foo`/`FooRef`/`FooMut` layout triple, ❌ no `unsafe`,
//    ❌ no sanitizers and no C-vs-Rust equivalence harness (there is no C to call).
//
// 4. CRATE RULES BIND YOU — `crates/compiler/deeptools/CLAUDE.md`, read it in full.
//    🛑 NEVER RUNTIME REFUSE: no `Result`, no `Err(`, no `.ok_or`, no `assert!`, no `debug_assert!`
//    (frozen at zero by crates/targets/spyre/tests/dfir_never_runtime_refuses.rs). A closed set is
//    an `enum`; an invariant is a TYPE. `todo!("<op> …")` is tolerated, capped and ratcheted down —
//    and ⛔ never substitute a stand-in op to dodge one. Newtypes, never raw scalars. No strings for
//    closed sets. `Arch`/`Model`/`Workload` flow through as const generics.
//
// 5. ANCHORS: each `// crustify:todo: e<NNN>_<name>` below is one scheduled unit. Replace it with
//    the ported function carrying the doc anchor `/// Replaces: e<NNN>_<name>` on the item itself.
//    A surviving TODO is open work; the TODO must not survive beside the filled anchor.
//
// 6. TESTS: `#[cfg(test)] mod unit_tests` beside the code. 668 of the authority tree's 825
//    `dcc/test/**/*.mlir` cases carry `CHECK-SENT-IR` expectations — port the EXPECTATION, build the
//    typed input in Rust (this crate has no MLIR parser and must not get one).
//    `crates/compiler/deeptools/tests/sentient_corpus/` is the answer key (our DataflowIR beside the
//    reference's SentientIR for the same program).
//
// 7. GATE: `cargo check -p deeptools` and `cargo test -p deeptools`. ⛔ NEVER run the workspace or
//    acceptance build in an agent worktree — ~6 GB of target/ each and <50 GB free on this host.
//
// 8. `dataflow_ir_to_sentient/agen_to_sentient.rs` is the EARLIER PARTIAL ATTEMPT (predicates, no
//    emission, called by nothing). Nothing in it counts as ported; reuse what is right, but every
//    unit gets its own anchored item here.

///
/// # ⛔⛔ THE LOOP'S STEP IS AN ERASE, AND THE PORT HAS TO STATE IT AS A RULE
///
/// `while (true)` re-walks from scratch every round and always takes the FIRST view it finds
/// (`:49-54`). It terminates because `TPMVManager::run()` DELETES the view it lowered —
/// `info.paged_mem_view_->erase()` (`TransformPagedMemViewImpl.cpp:621`) — so the next walk finds a
/// different one. Nothing in this crate erases an op out of the caller's program, so a port that
/// simply looped would never stop; the loop has to be re-expressed over the views a walk finds ONCE,
/// with an explicit rule for which of them an earlier round already consumed.
///
/// ⛔ AND "ONE ROUND, ONE VIEW" IS THE WRONG RULE — IT DOUBLE-COUNTS EVERY LOAD-AND-STORE PAIR.
/// `TPMVVectorLoadStore::initialize` registers TWO `TPMVInfo`s, one for the load's memref and one for
/// the store's (`Impl.cpp:762`, `:769-770`), and `TPMVCompositeLoadStore::initialize` does the same
/// for `src` and `dst` (`:1191-1202`); `TPMVBase::transform` then erases the view of EVERY non-null
/// one (`:596-621`, skipping the nulls at `:599`). So a pair's second view is already gone when the
/// next round walks, and a port that gave it a round of its own would report twice the work the
/// reference does — on the vendor's own composite input, two rounds where dcc runs one
/// (`paged_mem_view_load_and_store.mlir:1084-1094`).
///
/// # ⭐ THE RULE, AND WHY IT IS EXACTLY THE ERASE SET
///
/// A view is skipped when the manager's answer for it REPEATS an answer already given in this unit.
/// That is not a heuristic — it is the erase set restated:
///
/// * A [`Selection`] names the leaf the reference builds, and every leaf holds `mem_ops_` — the ONE
///   memory op `TPMVBase::new` seeded it with
///   ([`super::tf_transform_paged_mem_view_impl::TpmvBase::new`]).
/// * Two DISTINCT views answer with the same leaf only when they have the same single user, since
///   the manager dispatches on `*paged_mem_view_->getUsers().begin()` and nothing else
///   (`TransformPagedMemViewManager.cpp:22-25`) — and an op that reads two paged views is exactly a
///   load-and-store pattern or a composite transfer, the two cases whose `initialize` registers both.
/// * The vector pair is the one case where the two views have DIFFERENT users, the load and its
///   store — and the manager normalises it: from either view it builds
///   `TPMVVectorLoadStore(load_op, store_op, comp)` (`:33`, `:45`), and that constructor keeps only
///   the load (`Impl.cpp:756-757` asserts the one-element `mem_ops_`). The two rounds would be the
///   same value, so the second is the one the erase removed.
///
/// ⛔ AND `==` IS SOUND HERE EVEN THOUGH THE OPS COMPARE BY VALUE AND NOT BY ADDRESS, which is the
/// one thing this rule could have got wrong. A leaf names its memory op, and that op names the view
/// it reads (`view` on an access, `src`/`dst` on a transfer). So two rounds whose leaves compare
/// equal are rounds whose memory ops read the SAME view — and a view read twice has two users, which
/// is [`Selection::NotOneUser`] and not a `Selected` round at all. Two structurally identical
/// accesses on DIFFERENT views cannot collide, because the view is part of what is compared.
///
/// ⭐ WHICH ALSO MAKES THE PORT TERMINATE BY CONSTRUCTION: the rounds run over a finite list of views
/// collected once, rather than over a re-walk whose progress depends on an unported erase.
///
/// # ⛔ A NON-`Selected` ANSWER ENDS THE UNIT AND ONLY THE UNIT
///
/// `if (tpmv_manager.run().failed()) { signalPassFailure(); return; }` (`:58-60`) returns from the
/// WALK LAMBDA, which is `void` — so it abandons this unit's `while (true)` and the walk carries on
/// to the next `program_unit`. It does not abandon the module.
///
/// ⭐ AND [`Selection::NotOneUser`] / [`Selection::Unsupported`] STOP IT FOR A SECOND, INDEPENDENT
/// REASON. They are the manager's `DT_CHECK` and `llvm_unreachable`, which in the reference stop the
/// process outright; entry 139 turns them into values because this crate never runtime-refuses. A
/// round that selected nothing also consumed nothing, so the reference's own loop could not have made
/// progress past one — which is why it is a hard stop there and the last round for this unit here.
///
/// ⭐ `signalPassFailure()` (`:58`) IS A FLAG ON THE PASS OBJECT, and the port's flag is the round
/// itself: a unit whose last round is not [`Selection::Selected`] is a unit the reference would have
/// failed the build over. Keeping it as data rather than as a returned status is what lets a caller
/// say which unit and which view, which is more than the reference's own diagnostic carries.
///
/// ⚠️ `run()` ITSELF CANNOT FAIL YET. Its `LogicalResult` comes from `initialize()` and `transform()`
/// (entries 202, 356 and 373, unported), so what a round reports today is which leaf the reference
/// would have run — the delegated-emission shape entry 139 already committed this pass to, and the
/// one entry 109 records for a transform that upstream MLIR performs.
///
/// # ⭐ WHAT THE MODULE IS, AND WHY THE BORROW IS SHARED
///
/// `ModuleOp module_op = getOperation()` (`:42`) — this island's module is a
/// [`Program`]: its preamble plus its units, which is how
/// [`super::tf_program_units_reduction::module_scope`] spells the same thing. And the parameter is
/// `&`, for the reason [`super::tf_cfg_simplification_dataflow_level::run_on_operation`] (entry 383)
/// records for its own: the rewriting this pass does is `initialize()` and `transform()`, entries 202
/// and 356, so there is nothing yet to write back. It becomes `&mut` in the changeset that lands the
/// erase.
///
/// ⭐ AND THE WALK FOR `dataflow::ProgramUnitOp` (`:43`) IS THE UNITS LIST, not a search.
/// [`crate::islands::dataflow_ir::ProgramUnits`] is where a program's units live — a field rather
/// than ops among ops, and non-empty by construction — so `walk` becomes `iter()`, exactly as entry
/// 383 does it. The `dataflow.program_unit` OP variant exists for printing a unit inside a body, and
/// a program that nested one there would be one this island's own emitter cannot build.
///
/// ⚠️ `opts_` (`:34`, `:38`) IS READ BY NOTHING IN THIS FUNCTION. The pass takes a
/// `dcc::CommonPassOptions` in its constructor and stores it; `runOnOperation` never mentions it. It
/// is one of the campaign's 106 exclusions (`docs/bridge2-porting-order.md:1565`), and the two
/// `createTransformPagedMemViewPass` factories that hand it over (`:70-78`) are pass registration,
/// which no entry covers.
///
/// # ⭐ WHERE THE COMPONENT COMES FROM
///
/// The reference resolves it through the op —
/// `getUnitType(unit_op.getUnits()[0].getDefiningOp<GetUnitOp>())` — because MLIR's unit list is a
/// list of `Value`s and the `type` attribute lives on their defining op.
/// [`crate::islands::dataflow_ir::Units`] carries the kind ITSELF, and carries it as the FILTER its
/// only list constructor selected on (`Units::of`), so every value in the list including
/// `getUnits()[0]` is bound by a `dataflow.get_unit` of that type. Reading `on.kind()` is the same
/// fact without the `getDefiningOp` that returns null —
/// [`super::tf_program_units_reduction`]'s `head_get_unit` goes through the op because entry 193 also
/// needs the `core`/`corelet` attributes, which only the op carries.
///
/// ⭐ AND THE SCOPE IS THE UNIT'S OWN BODY, not the module. The reference's `getUsers()` is global,
/// but a view found by `unit_op.walk` is DEFINED INSIDE that unit's region, and MLIR requires every
/// use to be dominated by its definition — a value defined inside a region is not visible outside
/// it. So the unit's body holds every user there can be.
