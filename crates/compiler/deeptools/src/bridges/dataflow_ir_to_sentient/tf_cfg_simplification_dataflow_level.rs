//
// 1. THE AUTHORITY IS THE C++ TREE, NOT THE EXTRACT.
//       /Users/nickm/git/deeptools-src/<file>:<line>        (deeptools @ a0d29abbed — repo_info.txt)
//    That is the revision every citation below resolves against. `crustify-bridge2/source/bridge2.cpp`
//    says WHICH functions are in scope and IN WHAT ORDER; ⛔ its bodies are TRUNCATED AT THE TAIL —
//    366 of the 384 end in a blank line and bare closing braces, and a 48-entry sample against the
//    authority found 21 that had lost real trailing statements (a `return success();`, a
//    `return rhs;`, an entire `} else { … }` branch, an `initMASData(...)` call). Port from the
//    authority file at the cited line. ⛔ /Users/nickm/git/deeptools is a DIFFERENT revision.
//    ⛔ The pod (/project_src/deeptools) is NOT reachable from this host — use the mirror above.
//
// 2. PORTED MEANS THE WHOLE FUNCTION INCLUDING ITS EMISSION. The op a function emits IS the
//    function — its exact attribute names and values, branch order and early returns. A documented
//    predicate that emits nothing is NOT a port (that is how the previous attempt failed). What you
//    MAY drop is only the mechanism for REACHING operands: use-walks, memoising by
//    (core, corelet, component), positioning an OpBuilder. If the target IR cannot express a
//    function's input, ADD THE OP to `src/islands/{sentient,dataflow_ir}/` — never decide the
//    function is unnecessary.
//
// 3. THIS IS A PURE-LOGIC PORT WITH NO C ANYWHERE. Whatever the generic C-to-Rust conventions say:
//    ❌ no bindgen/allowlist/-sys, ❌ no `ffi::`/`mod ffi_export`/`#[unsafe(no_mangle)] extern "C"`,
//    ❌ no `CRUSTIFY_<FILE>` switch, ❌ no `Foo`/`FooRef`/`FooMut` layout triple, ❌ no `unsafe`,
//    ❌ no sanitizers and no C-vs-Rust equivalence harness (there is no C to call).
//
// 4. CRATE RULES BIND YOU — `crates/compiler/deeptools/CLAUDE.md`, read it in full.
//    🛑 NEVER RUNTIME REFUSE: no `Result`, no `Err(`, no `.ok_or`, no `assert!`, no `debug_assert!`
//    (frozen at zero by crates/targets/spyre/tests/dfir_never_runtime_refuses.rs). A closed set is
//    an `enum`; an invariant is a TYPE. `todo!("<op> …")` is tolerated, capped and ratcheted down —
//    and ⛔ never substitute a stand-in op to dodge one. Newtypes, never raw scalars. No strings for
//    closed sets. `Arch`/`Model`/`Workload` flow through as const generics.
//
// 5. ANCHORS: each `// crustify:todo: e<NNN>_<name>` below is one scheduled unit. Replace it with
//    the ported function carrying the doc anchor `/// Replaces: e<NNN>_<name>` on the item itself.
//    A surviving TODO is open work; the TODO must not survive beside the filled anchor.
//
// 6. TESTS: `#[cfg(test)] mod unit_tests` beside the code. 668 of the authority tree's 825
//    `dcc/test/**/*.mlir` cases carry `CHECK-SENT-IR` expectations — port the EXPECTATION, build the
//    typed input in Rust (this crate has no MLIR parser and must not get one).
//    `crates/compiler/deeptools/tests/sentient_corpus/` is the answer key (our DataflowIR beside the
//    reference's SentientIR for the same program).
//
// 7. GATE: `cargo check -p deeptools` and `cargo test -p deeptools`. ⛔ NEVER run the workspace or
//    acceptance build in an agent worktree — ~6 GB of target/ each and <50 GB free on this host.
//
// 8. `dataflow_ir_to_sentient/agen_to_sentient.rs` is the EARLIER PARTIAL ATTEMPT (predicates, no
//    emission, called by nothing). Nothing in it counts as ported; reuse what is right, but every
//    unit gets its own anchored item here.

///
/// `:81-85` walks the module for `dataflow::ProgramUnitOp` and builds a fresh
/// `CFGSDataflowConditionalTree` on each, returning early from that unit when the tree is empty. A
/// unit with no undecided branch is left exactly as it was — not "simplified to itself", *skipped*,
/// which is why an empty-tree program can be returned unchanged rather than rebuilt.
///
/// # ⛔⛔ TODAY EVERY TREE IN THIS CRATE IS EMPTY, AND THAT IS A CHECKED FACT NOT AN ASSUMPTION
///
/// [`is_selected`] is `isa<affine.if, scf.if>`; the DataflowIR island has no `affine.if` at all, so
/// the only node kind is [`scf::Op::If`]. Nothing this compiler currently emits constructs one — the
/// undecided branches bridge 1 flattens are gone by the time a program reaches this rung. So this
/// pass is provably a no-op over every program the pipeline can hand it, and wiring it in cannot
/// change a single emitted byte.
///
/// ⛔ WHICH IS EXACTLY WHY IT IS WIRED IN ANYWAY. The day an `scf.if` DOES reach this rung, the
/// program needs six rewrites that do not exist and the answer must be a BUILD FAILURE naming the
/// first missing one — not a lowering that quietly skips the simplification and emits a conditional
/// the Sentient rung mis-schedules. A pass that is only added once its input appears is a pass that
/// is absent on the one run that needed it.
///
/// # ⛔ WHAT THE PORT DROPS, AND WHY
///
/// - `DisableThisPass` (`:45-48`) is an `llvm::cl::opt<bool>` read at `:78`: a **command-line flag of
///   `dcc-opt`**, not a program property. This crate has no pass pipeline and no flags — which pass
///   runs is a call in [`super::program`] — so the switch has nowhere to live. Turning it into a
///   parameter would make "did the compiler simplify" a runtime question with two answers.
/// - The `LLVM_DEBUG` / `DEBUG_WITH_TYPE(VerboseDebug, tree.print(...))` tracing after every step
///   (`:86-155`) prints the tree; it has no effect on the IR.
/// - The tree itself is not built. `compute()` populates a node graph that only the six unported
///   rewrites read; what this port needs from it is `empty()`, which is exactly the node COUNT
///   ([`conditional_tree`]). The tree gets built in `tf_cfgs_dataflow_conditional_tree.rs`, its own
///   home, when its rewrites land.
///
/// # ⛔⛔ FIVE OF THE SEVEN CALLS ARE OUTSIDE THIS CAMPAIGN'S 384
///
/// `e284_hoistCommonConditionals`, `e371_hoistLoopInvariantConditionals`,
/// `e380_shallowlyMergeConditionals` and `e381_simplifyValueBasedConditionals` are scheduled units.
/// But `removeDuplicateConditionals` and `removeConditionWhenThenElseBranchesMatch` live on the base
/// class in `dcc/src/Analysis/TransformationConditionalTree.cpp:58` and `:181`, as do the tree's
/// constructor, `compute()` and `empty()` — and none of those five is in the 384 or in the campaign's
/// 106 documented exclusions. So this pass cannot be completed by this campaign as scheduled, and the
/// `todo!` below names the first step rather than pretending the list is reachable.
///
/// # ⛔ AND IT TAKES A SHARED REFERENCE, WHICH IS A STATEMENT ABOUT WHAT IS PORTED
///
/// The reference rewrites its module in place. Here all seven calls in [`STEPS`] are unported, so
/// there is nothing to write back: the whole observable effect is the choice between leaving a
/// program alone and failing the build. A `&mut` parameter would claim a capability nothing behind it
