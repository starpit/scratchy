//! `DataflowIR -> SentientIR` — the D1-D28 span, as one lowering over the TYPED program.
//!
//! # 🛑 THERE IS NO MLIR TEXT ON THE INPUT SIDE
//!
//! ⛔⛔ THIS BRIDGE IS CALLED WHERE THE TYPED VALUE LIVES, and that is the only place it can be
//! called: `lower_subtile_tape_to_dataflow_ir.rs`'s `emit_run` holds the
//! [`dataflow_ir::Run`] that `tape::compile` just produced and prints it ONLY because `dbo-opt`
//! consumes characters. Nothing in this crate parses MLIR and nothing should — so a bridge that
//! took text would need a whole second front end, and a bridge validated against text fixtures
//! would need the input transcribed by hand.
//!
//! ⭐ THE VALIDATOR IS THE ACCEPTANCE BUILD.
//! `cargo build -Fsuperdsc,model/granite-3.1-2b-instruct,quant/fp8-dynamic-per-channel` runs this
//! over every program the bake stages — 417 of them, six op-funcs — and a [`todo!`] here stops it
//! and names the op. There is no unit test that can say anything this cannot.
//!
//! # 🛑 WHAT THE REFERENCE'S OWN OUTPUT DEMANDS
//!
//! ⭐ MEASURED ACROSS ALL 417 PROGRAMS, the reference's SentientIR uses **seven** of the dialect's
//! twenty-nine ops: `scalar_constant` (3,094), `load_and_store` (943), `load_and_send` (943),
//! `vector_binary` (417), `receive_and_store` (417), `vector_mac` (386), `for` (45). So the output
//! surface is seven ops, and `dataflow.get_unit` (2,502) and `dataflow.program_unit` (1,668)
//! SURVIVE — the rung is mixed, not a dialect swap.
//!
//! ⛔ AND FOUR STRUCTURAL FACTS THE SMALLEST GOLDEN STATES OUTRIGHT
//! (`tests/sentient_corpus/group_0__g0_0_mul.sentient.mlir`, 30 lines):
//!
//! 1. The constants are HOISTED ABOVE THE `get_unit`s, and there are **two separate zeros**.
//! 2. The `constant` unit's `get_unit` is **DROPPED** — seven in, six out.
//! 3. Every `get_logical_memory_view` **VANISHES**; a transfer names the UNIT, not the view.
//! 4. Ops FUSE ACROSS the DataflowIR statement boundary: a load and its send become one
//!    `load_and_send`, a receive and its store one `receive_and_store`, and one
//!    `vectorchain.binary` becomes **TWO** sentient computes.
