// 1. THE AUTHORITY IS THE C++ TREE, NOT THE EXTRACT.
//       /Users/nickm/git/deeptools-src/<file>:<line>        (deeptools @ a0d29abbed — repo_info.txt)
//    That is the revision every citation below resolves against. `crustify-bridge2/source/bridge2.cpp`
//    says WHICH functions are in scope and IN WHAT ORDER; ⛔ its bodies are TRUNCATED AT THE TAIL —
//    366 of the 384 end in a blank line and bare closing braces, and a 48-entry sample against the
//    authority found 21 that had lost real trailing statements (a `return success();`, a
//    `return rhs;`, an entire `} else { … }` branch, an `initMASData(...)` call). Port from the
//    authority file at the cited line. ⛔ /Users/nickm/git/deeptools is a DIFFERENT revision.
//    ⛔ The pod (/project_src/deeptools) is NOT reachable from this host — use the mirror above.
//
// 2. PORTED MEANS THE WHOLE FUNCTION INCLUDING ITS EMISSION. The op a function emits IS the
//    function — its exact attribute names and values, branch order and early returns. A documented
//    predicate that emits nothing is NOT a port (that is how the previous attempt failed). What you
//    MAY drop is only the mechanism for REACHING operands: use-walks, memoising by
//    (core, corelet, component), positioning an OpBuilder. If the target IR cannot express a
//    function's input, ADD THE OP to `src/islands/{sentient,dataflow_ir}/` — never decide the
//    function is unnecessary.
//
// 3. THIS IS A PURE-LOGIC PORT WITH NO C ANYWHERE. Whatever the generic C-to-Rust conventions say:
//    ❌ no bindgen/allowlist/-sys, ❌ no `ffi::`/`mod ffi_export`/`#[unsafe(no_mangle)] extern "C"`,
//    ❌ no `CRUSTIFY_<FILE>` switch, ❌ no `Foo`/`FooRef`/`FooMut` layout triple, ❌ no `unsafe`,
//    ❌ no sanitizers and no C-vs-Rust equivalence harness (there is no C to call).
//
// 4. CRATE RULES BIND YOU — `crates/compiler/deeptools/CLAUDE.md`, read it in full.
//    🛑 NEVER RUNTIME REFUSE: no `Result`, no `Err(`, no `.ok_or`, no `assert!`, no `debug_assert!`
//    (frozen at zero by crates/targets/spyre/tests/dfir_never_runtime_refuses.rs). A closed set is
//    an `enum`; an invariant is a TYPE. `todo!("<op> …")` is tolerated, capped and ratcheted down —
//    and ⛔ never substitute a stand-in op to dodge one. Newtypes, never raw scalars. No strings for
//    closed sets. `Arch`/`Model`/`Workload` flow through as const generics.
//
// 5. ANCHORS: each `// crustify:todo: e<NNN>_<name>` below is one scheduled unit. Replace it with
//    the ported function carrying the doc anchor `/// Replaces: e<NNN>_<name>` on the item itself.
//    A surviving TODO is open work; the TODO must not survive beside the filled anchor.
//
// 6. TESTS: `#[cfg(test)] mod unit_tests` beside the code. 668 of the authority tree's 825
//    `dcc/test/**/*.mlir` cases carry `CHECK-SENT-IR` expectations — port the EXPECTATION, build the
//    typed input in Rust (this crate has no MLIR parser and must not get one).
//    `crates/compiler/deeptools/tests/sentient_corpus/` is the answer key (our DataflowIR beside the
//    reference's SentientIR for the same program).
//
// 7. GATE: `cargo check -p deeptools` and `cargo test -p deeptools`. ⛔ NEVER run the workspace or
//    acceptance build in an agent worktree — ~6 GB of target/ each and <50 GB free on this host.
//
// 8. `dataflow_ir_to_sentient/agen_to_sentient.rs` is the EARLIER PARTIAL ATTEMPT (predicates, no
//    emission, called by nothing). Nothing in it counts as ported; reuse what is right, but every
//    unit gets its own anchored item here.

/// transfer's coefficients, and the Sentient loop lowering counts `affine.for` nesting against
/// [`crate::arch::Arch::MAX_NESTED_LOOPS`]. An `scf.for` reaching the lowering is not a legal input,
/// which is what this pass's name says. The reason one is there in the first place is a bound that is
/// not a constant — `%10 = arith.select %9, %c16, %c32` (`scf_loop_with_result.mlir:128`) — and
/// [`crate::islands::dataflow_ir::dialects::affine::Bound`] has no variant for a computed value
/// because `affine.for` has no way to take one.
///
/// # ⭐ `0` AND `1` ARE PASSED LITERALLY, NOT `lbound` AND `step`
///
/// `AffineForOp::create(builder, loc, 0, ubound, 1, inits)` — the guarded values are the only ones the
/// build could use, and passing them again would suggest otherwise. This island's `affine.for` has no
/// step field at all (a step of 1 is what `affine.for %i = 0 to N` means), so the `1` is discharged by
/// the type.
///
/// # ⛔ THE INITS PASS THROUGH UNCHANGED, AND THAT IS LOAD-BEARING
///
/// `scf_for.getInits()` is evaluated OUTSIDE the loop, so those values are not in the mapping and must
/// not be renumbered — the vendor's expectation shows the same `%20` initialising both branches'
/// copies (`scf_loop_with_result.mlir:41` and `:64`). Only the induction variable, the region
/// arguments and whatever the body itself defines get new names.
///
/// # ⛔ THE MAPPING IS SEEDED BEFORE THE CLONE, WHICH IS WHY THE ORDER HERE IS FIXED
///
/// Mint the results, then the induction variable, then the region arguments — MLIR's own definition
/// order, and therefore its print order — seed the mapping with `(source iv, new iv)` and each
/// `(source arg, new arg)`, and only then clone. A body op reads the induction variable, so a clone
/// that ran first would carry the old name.
///
/// # ⚠️ `bv_map.lookup` ASSERTS; THIS PORT PASSES THE VALUE THROUGH
///
/// `IRMapping::lookup` on an unmapped value returns null and MLIR then fails a verifier;
/// [`ValueMapping::lookup_or_default`] returns the value itself. The two agree on every yield operand
/// the body defines, and where the yield forwards a value from OUTSIDE the loop — a legal `scf.for`
/// (`%c2048` yielded straight through) — passing it through is the only answer that is not a stop.

/// silence.

/// `!cb && cb` on the affine path, so `analyzeLoop` never answers `KSplitParent` for an
/// `affine.for` — see [`analyze_loop`]'s own table. The pairing is not merely unlikely; it is a
/// consequence of the only function that produces the second argument.
///
/// # ⭐ THE THREE BOUND READS ARE UNCONDITIONAL IN THE REFERENCE AND USED ON ONE PATH
///
/// `:417-421` reads `lb_const`, `ub_const` and `step_const` before `:422` looks at `type`, so the
/// split path reads them and throws all three away. `getDefiningOp<T>()` is a pure query returning
/// null on a mismatch, so reading them inside the `KUnroll` arm — where the one use is — is the same
/// program. That is also why the port needs `scope`: it is this island's `getDefiningOp`.
///
/// # ⛔⛔ `ub_const.value()` IS SAFE ONLY BECAUSE ENTRY 194 ORDERS ITS TESTS THE WAY IT DOES
///
/// The three `getDefiningOp<arith::ConstantIndexOp>()`s are read with NO null check. An `scf.for`
/// whose bound is an `arith.select` would fault here — and cannot arrive, because `analyzeLoop` tests
/// `!constant_bounds` at `:340-343` and the register file only at `:347-390`, so a non-constant
/// `scf.for` on a unit that owns one leaves as `KSplitParent` and never reaches `KUnroll`.
///
/// ⭐⭐ AND THE VENDOR PROVES IT ON AN INPUT WHERE BOTH TESTS MATCH — `dyn-loops-cond-bound.mlir` runs
/// on `ptrow0` (`:148`) and its `scf.for` (`:173`) has an `arith.select` bound (`:172`) with the
/// induction variable read by a store on `pt_lrfreg` (`:181`, `:154`). The answer is `scf.if` (`:47`),
/// not an unrolled loop. See
/// [`a_non_constant_bound_splits_before_the_register_file_is_consulted`](unit_tests::a_non_constant_bound_splits_before_the_register_file_is_consulted).
///
/// ⭐ SO A MISSING CONSTANT ANSWERS [`LoopRewrite::Nothing`], the same answer the reference's own
/// silent pairings give: the loop is left exactly as it stands, which is what "this cannot happen"
/// claims about it, and dbo-opt is the oracle if the claim was ever wrong.
///
/// ⛔ AND SO DOES AN `unroll_size` OF ZERO OR LESS. `lb = ub` is a loop the folder produces routinely
/// and `(ub - lb) / step` is then `0`, which reaches `loopUnrollByFactor`'s `assert(unrollFactor > 0)`
/// — the very defect [`TripCount`](super::tf_loop_unroll_for_shuffle_op::TripCount) exists to keep out
/// of this crate, documented there for entry 109. Leaving an empty loop alone is what unrolling it
/// zero times would have meant.
///
