// ╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
//
// 1. THE AUTHORITY IS THE C++ TREE, NOT THE EXTRACT.
//       /Users/nickm/git/deeptools-src/<file>:<line>        (deeptools @ a0d29abbed — repo_info.txt)
//    That is the revision every citation below resolves against. `crustify-bridge2/source/bridge2.cpp`
//    says WHICH functions are in scope and IN WHAT ORDER; ⛔ its bodies are TRUNCATED AT THE TAIL —
//    366 of the 384 end in a blank line and bare closing braces, and a 48-entry sample against the
//    authority found 21 that had lost real trailing statements (a `return success();`, a
//    `return rhs;`, an entire `} else { … }` branch, an `initMASData(...)` call). Port from the
//    authority file at the cited line. ⛔ /Users/nickm/git/deeptools is a DIFFERENT revision.
//    ⛔ The pod (/project_src/deeptools) is NOT reachable from this host — use the mirror above.
//
// 2. PORTED MEANS THE WHOLE FUNCTION INCLUDING ITS EMISSION. The op a function emits IS the
//    function — its exact attribute names and values, branch order and early returns. A documented
//    predicate that emits nothing is NOT a port (that is how the previous attempt failed). What you
//    MAY drop is only the mechanism for REACHING operands: use-walks, memoising by
//    (core, corelet, component), positioning an OpBuilder. If the target IR cannot express a
//    function's input, ADD THE OP to `src/islands/{sentient,dataflow_ir}/` — never decide the
//    function is unnecessary.
//
// 3. THIS IS A PURE-LOGIC PORT WITH NO C ANYWHERE. Whatever the generic C-to-Rust conventions say:
//    ❌ no bindgen/allowlist/-sys, ❌ no `ffi::`/`mod ffi_export`/`#[unsafe(no_mangle)] extern "C"`,
//    ❌ no `CRUSTIFY_<FILE>` switch, ❌ no `Foo`/`FooRef`/`FooMut` layout triple, ❌ no `unsafe`,
//    ❌ no sanitizers and no C-vs-Rust equivalence harness (there is no C to call).
//
// 4. CRATE RULES BIND YOU — `crates/compiler/deeptools/CLAUDE.md`, read it in full.
//    🛑 NEVER RUNTIME REFUSE: no `Result`, no `Err(`, no `.ok_or`, no `assert!`, no `debug_assert!`
//    (frozen at zero by crates/targets/spyre/tests/dfir_never_runtime_refuses.rs). A closed set is
//    an `enum`; an invariant is a TYPE. `todo!("<op> …")` is tolerated, capped and ratcheted down —
//    and ⛔ never substitute a stand-in op to dodge one. Newtypes, never raw scalars. No strings for
//    closed sets. `Arch`/`Model`/`Workload` flow through as const generics.
//
// 5. ANCHORS: each `// crustify:todo: e<NNN>_<name>` below is one scheduled unit. Replace it with
//    the ported function carrying the doc anchor `/// Replaces: e<NNN>_<name>` on the item itself.
//    A surviving TODO is open work; the TODO must not survive beside the filled anchor.
//
// 6. TESTS: `#[cfg(test)] mod unit_tests` beside the code. 668 of the authority tree's 825
//    `dcc/test/**/*.mlir` cases carry `CHECK-SENT-IR` expectations — port the EXPECTATION, build the
//    typed input in Rust (this crate has no MLIR parser and must not get one).
//    `crates/compiler/deeptools/tests/sentient_corpus/` is the answer key (our DataflowIR beside the
//    reference's SentientIR for the same program).
//
// 7. GATE: `cargo check -p deeptools` and `cargo test -p deeptools`. ⛔ NEVER run the workspace or
//    acceptance build in an agent worktree — ~6 GB of target/ each and <50 GB free on this host.
//
// 8. `dataflow_ir_to_sentient/agen_to_sentient.rs` is the EARLIER PARTIAL ATTEMPT (predicates, no
//    emission, called by nothing). Nothing in it counts as ported; reuse what is right, but every
//    unit gets its own anchored item here.

///
/// # ⛔ AN UNNAMED OPERATION ANYWHERE IN THE LIST ABANDONS THE WHOLE NAME
///
/// `dbgName` is a *discardable* attribute, so `getDbgNameAttr` returns null for any op that has none
/// (`DataflowOpInterfaces.cpp:24-36`) — hence `Option<&str>` per operation rather than `&str`. The
/// early `return nullptr` throws away the partially built string, so the result is all-or-nothing and
/// `?` is exactly it. ⭐ AND SEVEN OF THE TEN CALLERS TREAT IT THAT WAY: `if (StringAttr n =
/// getNewDbgNameFromList(...)) setDbgNameAttr(dst, n);`, which leaves the destination's existing name
/// alone rather than clearing it — `setDbgNameAttr(dst, nullptr)` would REMOVE the attribute
/// (`DataflowOpInterfaces.cpp:49`), so the guard is load-bearing.
///
/// ⚠️ THE OTHER THREE HAND THE NULL STRAIGHT TO A `create()`. `SyncSendRecvFusion.cpp:93`,
/// `PCFGToDataflowIR.cpp:1773` and `:3953` pass the result to `SyncOp::create` / `MergeOp::create` /
/// `PackOp::create` as the new op's dbg-name attribute with no guard at all, so there `None` means
/// the op being BUILT is unnamed. Either reading is `Option<String>`; neither is a refusal.
///
/// ⚠️ THE `MLIRContext` IS DROPPED, and it is the one thing here that is pure mechanism:
/// `StringAttr::get(list_of_ops.front()->getContext(), s)` interns the string in the context that
/// already owns the ops. A `String` needs no interner. This is why the head is still worth naming
/// even though the string no longer needs `front()`.
///
/// ⭐ WHY A `String` AND NOT A NEWTYPE: a debug name is free text the scheduler wrote — `"in-7/6"`,
/// `"SCF-If #1"`, `"condition__3"` — and the SentientIR island already carries it as

/// # ⭐⭐ EXACTLY ONE TERMINATOR SURVIVES EACH ARM, AND WHICH ONE IS THE WHOLE FUNCTION
///
/// Two conditionals on the same condition become one, so each arm ends up with two statement lists
/// and two `yield`s where a block may have only one. The rule is that **the yield of the conditional
/// that binds values survives**, because its operands are the merged op's results — and
/// `areShallowlyMergeable` has already guaranteed that at most one of the two binds anything
/// (`:348`). The other three combinations follow from program order:
///
/// | order | who binds | erased | the surviving terminator ends up |
/// |---|---|---|---|
/// | [`MergeOrder::DstFirst`] | neither | `dst`'s | last, and it is `src`'s (`:421-422`, `:429-431`) |
/// | [`MergeOrder::DstFirst`] | `dst` | `src`'s | last, moved back there after the splice (`:433-434`) |
/// | [`MergeOrder::SrcFirst`] | neither | `src`'s | last, and it is `dst`'s (`:440-441`) |
/// | [`MergeOrder::SrcFirst`] | `src` | `dst`'s | last, where `dst`'s used to be (`:446-447`) |
///
/// ⛔ THE TWO `DT_CHECK`s ARE NOT CHECKS ON THE TERMINATORS THEY NAME (`:425-426`, `:444-445`).
/// `src_terminator->getNumResults()`
/// is the yield OP's own result count, which is zero for every `scf.yield` and `affine.yield` ever
/// built — a yield binds nothing, it only carries operands. The condition the messages describe
/// ("Expect src to not yield any results if dst does") is the one `areShallowlyMergeable` enforces on
/// the CONDITIONALS, so nothing is lost by their absence here.
///
/// # ⛔ THE `while` LOOPS ARE A DIRECTION, NOT A COUNT
///
/// `moveBefore(&dst_bb, dst_bb.end())` taken over `front()` repeatedly appends in order (`:429-431`);
/// `moveBefore(&dst_bb, dst_bb.begin())` taken over `back()` repeatedly prepends in order
/// (`:449-451`). Both are
/// "splice src's statements in, keeping their order" — one at the end, one at the start — which is
/// [`Vec::append`] and a prepend of the taken list.
///
/// # ⭐ THE EMPTY-ARM CASE IS WHY ENTRY 096 EXISTS
///
/// A conditional with no `else` block has nothing to splice against, so the side that is missing one
/// gets a bare terminator first ([`create_dummy_yield_in_else_reg`]) and the arm then has two lists.
/// ⚠️ THE REFERENCE FILLS REGION **1** WHATEVER `i` IS — `createDummyYieldInElseReg` indexes
/// `getRegions()[1]` unconditionally (`:388`) — so on `i == 0` it would fill the `else` arm and then
/// dereference an absent `then` block. That is unreachable for a verified conditional, whose `then`
/// region always has a block; here the same call is made and an arm that is still empty splices
/// nothing into nothing.
///
/// # ⛔ THE NAME IS PART OF THE MERGE
///
/// The last three lines are not logging: `dbgName` is how the reference's own `CHECK` lines identify a
/// merged conditional, and the expectation for this file's fixture after two merges is
/// `} {dbgName = "CFGSM(SCF-If #4, CFGSM(SCF-If #2, SCF-If #3))"}`
/// (`dcc/test/Transform/CFGSimplificationDataflowLevel/merging.mlir:59`) — nested, because the second
/// merge reads the name the first one wrote. A conditional whose halves are not both named keeps its
/// own name, which is [`new_dbg_name_from_list`] returning `None`.
///
/// ⭐ THE SOURCE IS LEFT AS AN EMPTY CONDITIONAL, NOT DELETED. `shallowlyMergeConditionals` collects
/// it into `ops_to_delete` and erases it, with its dead ancestors, after the walk (`:242`, `:257`,
/// `:269`) — so this function's postcondition is "src's arms are spliced out", not "src is gone".
