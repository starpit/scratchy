//
// 1. THE AUTHORITY IS THE C++ TREE, NOT THE EXTRACT.
//       /Users/nickm/git/deeptools-src/<file>:<line>        (deeptools @ a0d29abbed — repo_info.txt)
//    That is the revision every citation below resolves against. `crustify-bridge2/source/bridge2.cpp`
//    says WHICH functions are in scope and IN WHAT ORDER; ⛔ its bodies are TRUNCATED AT THE TAIL —
//    366 of the 384 end in a blank line and bare closing braces, and a 48-entry sample against the
//    authority found 21 that had lost real trailing statements (a `return success();`, a
//    `return rhs;`, an entire `} else { … }` branch, an `initMASData(...)` call). Port from the
//    authority file at the cited line. ⛔ /Users/nickm/git/deeptools is a DIFFERENT revision.
//    ⛔ The pod (/project_src/deeptools) is NOT reachable from this host — use the mirror above.
//
// 2. PORTED MEANS THE WHOLE FUNCTION INCLUDING ITS EMISSION. The op a function emits IS the
//    function — its exact attribute names and values, branch order and early returns. A documented
//    predicate that emits nothing is NOT a port (that is how the previous attempt failed). What you
//    MAY drop is only the mechanism for REACHING operands: use-walks, memoising by
//    (core, corelet, component), positioning an OpBuilder. If the target IR cannot express a
//    function's input, ADD THE OP to `src/islands/{sentient,dataflow_ir}/` — never decide the
//    function is unnecessary.
//
// 3. THIS IS A PURE-LOGIC PORT WITH NO C ANYWHERE. Whatever the generic C-to-Rust conventions say:
//    ❌ no bindgen/allowlist/-sys, ❌ no `ffi::`/`mod ffi_export`/`#[unsafe(no_mangle)] extern "C"`,
//    ❌ no `CRUSTIFY_<FILE>` switch, ❌ no `Foo`/`FooRef`/`FooMut` layout triple, ❌ no `unsafe`,
//    ❌ no sanitizers and no C-vs-Rust equivalence harness (there is no C to call).
//
// 4. CRATE RULES BIND YOU — `crates/compiler/deeptools/CLAUDE.md`, read it in full.
//    🛑 NEVER RUNTIME REFUSE: no `Result`, no `Err(`, no `.ok_or`, no `assert!`, no `debug_assert!`
//    (frozen at zero by crates/targets/spyre/tests/dfir_never_runtime_refuses.rs). A closed set is
//    an `enum`; an invariant is a TYPE. `todo!("<op> …")` is tolerated, capped and ratcheted down —
//    and ⛔ never substitute a stand-in op to dodge one. Newtypes, never raw scalars. No strings for
//    closed sets. `Arch`/`Model`/`Workload` flow through as const generics.
//
// 5. ANCHORS: each `// crustify:todo: e<NNN>_<name>` below is one scheduled unit. Replace it with
//    the ported function carrying the doc anchor `/// Replaces: e<NNN>_<name>` on the item itself.
//    A surviving TODO is open work; the TODO must not survive beside the filled anchor.
//
// 6. TESTS: `#[cfg(test)] mod unit_tests` beside the code. 668 of the authority tree's 825
//    `dcc/test/**/*.mlir` cases carry `CHECK-SENT-IR` expectations — port the EXPECTATION, build the
//    typed input in Rust (this crate has no MLIR parser and must not get one).
//    `crates/compiler/deeptools/tests/sentient_corpus/` is the answer key (our DataflowIR beside the
//    reference's SentientIR for the same program).
//
// 7. GATE: `cargo check -p deeptools` and `cargo test -p deeptools`. ⛔ NEVER run the workspace or
//    acceptance build in an agent worktree — ~6 GB of target/ each and <50 GB free on this host.
//
// 8. `dataflow_ir_to_sentient/agen_to_sentient.rs` is the EARLIER PARTIAL ATTEMPT (predicates, no
//    emission, called by nothing). Nothing in it counts as ported; reuse what is right, but every
//    unit gets its own anchored item here.

///
/// * NO `mask_parameter` — `static_mask = !mask_parameter`, a set that already says which lanes are
///   off;
/// * a parameter that is an `arith.constant` — ⛔ **PROMOTED TO STATIC**, by folding the literal into
///   the set's symbol (`replaceDimsAndSymbols`, `:69-77`). Without that fold the promoted set's `d0`
///   rows still hold `s0` and [`IntegerSet::constant_bound`] answers `None` for every one of them,
///   so `static_mask = true` would be followed by two `.value()` calls on absent bounds;
/// * a parameter that is an `arith.subi` of a loop's bound and its induction variable — DYNAMIC, and
///   the returned value is that induction variable.
///
/// The vendor writes all three in one file: `create_affine_mask {mask_set = #set2}` with no
/// parameter (`dynamic_pt_masking.mlir:296`), and `create_affine_mask %14 {mask_set = #set}` with
/// `%14 = arith.subi %13, %arg4` inside `sentient.for %arg4 = %13` (`:250-252`).
///
/// # THE STATIC ARM'S ARITHMETIC, PINNED BY A `CHECK-SENT-IR` LINE
///
/// `#set2 = affine_set<(d0) : (d0 - 48 >= 0, -d0 + 63 >= 0)>` over `vector<64xf16>`: `Ub` is 63,
/// which is `op_num_elems - 1` ✓; `Lb` is 48, so `num_masked_elems = 64 - 48 = 16` and
/// `masked_columns = 16 / 8 = 2` — and the golden is
/// `sentient.scalar_constant {value = 2 : si64}` (`dynamic_pt_masking.mlir:86`, `:211`). The
/// all-lanes-off set `(d0 - 64 >= 0, -d0 + 63 >= 0)` gives `64 - 64 = 0` columns and its golden is
/// `{value = 0 : si64}` (`:85`) — ⭐ an EMPTY set with `Lb > Ub`, which is why
/// [`IntegerSet::constant_bound`] must not test for emptiness.
///
/// # `OpBuilder builder(op)` — ⛔ THE INSERTION POINT IS RETURNED, NOT TAKEN
///
/// The builder is constructed AT the masked op, so the constant lands immediately before it. This
/// port hands the op back in [`MaskValue::Constant`] for the caller to place, which is this crate's
/// standing shape for an emission whose position is the caller's business.
///
/// # THE STOPS, EACH A CITED ABORT OR UB
///
/// * `getConstantBound(UB/LB, 0).value()` on an absent bound — `std::optional::value()` throws
///   (`:91-93`, `:101-103`). Two `todo!`s, because the two sides fail for different sets.
/// * `dyn_cast<arith::ConstantOp>(mask_parameter.getDefiningOp())` with a null defining op — LLVM's
///   `dyn_cast` asserts on null (`:70-71`), and the reference's own `DT_CHECK_MSG(mask_def_op, …)`
///   twenty lines later (`:124-125`) says the case was meant to be impossible.
/// * A region argument owned by something other than a `sentient.for` — see [`MaskParameterOwner`].
///
/// # THE DT_CHECKS THAT ARE **DISCHARGED BY CONSTRUCTION**
///
/// `comp == PT` is [`PtUnit`]; `op->getNumResults() == 1` and `dyn_cast<VectorType>` of both results
/// are the [`Vector`] parameters, which cannot be absent or of another kind; `op_num_elems %
/// numSlicesPerStick == 0` is [`PtLanes`] — ⚠️ and that last one is discharged in the TYPE, which
/// makes the reference's abort a DECLINE at the one place a `PtLanes` is minted
/// (`PtLanes::of::<A>(masked)?`). A row whose lanes do not divide into slices is not a mask this
/// lowering can read either way, and the crate's never-runtime-refuse rule leaves no third answer.
///
/// # ⛔ ONE DELIBERATE DIVERGENCE — THE STATIC ARM'S RANGE IS CLOSED AT BOTH ENDS HERE
///
/// The reference tests `num_masked_elems < 0` and its divisibility and never tests the other end, so
/// a lower bound below zero yields MORE masked columns than a slice has lanes and it emits that
/// constant. This port declines such a set; the check carries the arithmetic and the evidence. ⭐ No
