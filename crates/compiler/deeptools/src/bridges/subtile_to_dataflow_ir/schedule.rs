//! THE TEMPLATE'S SCHEDULE, WALKED.
//!
//! ⭐⭐ THE DDL TEMPLATE IS THE SCHEDULE AND THE NODE IS THE SHAPE. This file is the first half:
//! which units take part, what moves between them, in what loop nest, and where the computes sit —
//! all of it READ from the vendored template that `build.rs` walked, none of it invented. The
//! node's extents fill it in; neither side can be derived from the other.
//!
//! ⛔⛔ AN EMITTER THAT DID NOT READ `Program::stmts` WOULD BE INVENTING THE SCHEDULE, and would
//! look perfectly reasonable doing it. The first version of the tape walk emitted a hand-written
//! body shape and never called `OpFunc::program` at all.
//!
//! ⭐ THE CONDITIONS ARE ALREADY RESOLVED. `build.rs` flattens the branches it can decide for a
//! given op-bind — 995 exclusive branches across the vendored set — so `If` and `Dataflow` do not
//! appear among the statement kinds the reachable schedules use at all. What survives is
//! [`Enclosing::Arm`], the branches whose predicate the walk genuinely could not settle.
