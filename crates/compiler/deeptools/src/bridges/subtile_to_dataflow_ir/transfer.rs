//! HOW A TRANSFER IS WALKED — the AGEN time dimensions, ported from `DataTransferLowering.cpp`.
//!
//! ⛔⛔ AT MOST ONE HARDWARE VECTOR PER TIME STEP. "An AGEN composite transfer moves at most one
//! hardware vector per time step, so a transfer wider than that has to walk the remaining elements
//! over AGEN time dimensions instead of widening `load_iv`" (`:306-310`). Everything in this file
//! follows from that one sentence: a transfer either fits in a vector — one pinned time step, zero
//! offsets — or it is split, and then the innermost axis steps by a whole vector while every other
//! non-unit axis steps by one.
//!
//! ⭐ THIS IS SCHEDULING, WHICH IS WHY IT IS NOT IN THE ISLAND. The island holds the op and its
//! types; deciding how many time steps a transfer takes is a lowering decision, and putting it in
//! the data type is what would make it untestable on its own.
