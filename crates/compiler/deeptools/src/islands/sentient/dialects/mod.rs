//! THE SENTIENTIR OPS. One variant per operation an emitted program contains, under the dialect
//! that declares it.
//!
//! ⭐⭐ THE RUNG IS **MIXED**, AND THAT IS MEASURED, NOT ASSUMED. Running a real granite program
//! (`g0_0_mul`, from the bake's `group_0`) through the reference's own D1-D28 and dumping after
//! `DataflowToSentientLoweringPass` leaves:
//!
//! ```text
//! %0 = sentient.scalar_constant {value = 0 : si64} : index
//! %1 = dataflow.get_unit {name = "hbm", type = "hbm"} : index
//! %3 = dataflow.get_logical_memory_view %1, %0 {layout_map = #map} : ...
//! agen.composite_load_and_store src:%3[0, 0] dst:%4[0, 0] ...
//! ```
//!
//! One `sentient.*` op and three that are not. So SentientIR is not "the DataflowIR ops replaced" —
//! it is the same module with the compute and transfer bodies progressively rewritten, and
//! `dataflow.get_unit`, `dataflow.get_logical_memory_view` and the `agen` composites survive well
//! past the conversion named after them.
//!
//! ⛔ WHICH IS WHY THE SHARED DIALECTS ARE **RE-EXPORTED, NOT RE-DECLARED**. An `agen.vector_load`
//! is one operation of one dialect (`Agen.td`) whichever rung holds it, and two definitions of it
//! would be two things to keep in step. [`crate::islands::dataflow_ir::dialects`] owns them.
//!
//! ⚠️ EVENTUALLY THOSE SHARED MODULES BELONG AT `islands::dialects`, above both islands, rather than
//! under the lower one. That is a move across a file the DataflowIR island owns, so it wants doing
//! deliberately and not as a side effect of adding this island.
