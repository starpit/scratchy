//! THE SENTIENTIR ISLAND — the rung where the datapath is explicit but the registers are not yet
//! numbered.

//! ```text
//! DataflowIR ──D1–D28──► SentientIR ──D29–D75 (in place)──► ──D76──► ProgIR
//!                          (here)

//!
//! ⭐ WHERE THIS SITS, MEASURED. `dbo/docs/pass_pipeline.md` on the pod names every pass D1-D76;
//! D1-D28 is `buildDSCToSentientIRPipeline`, D29-D75 rewrite SentientIR in place (the prologue,
//! `O2Pipeline` run as three rounds, and `registerManagementPasses`), and D76 `SentientToProgIR`
//! leaves MLIR entirely.
//!
//! ⛔⛔ AND THE RUNG IS **MIXED**, NOT A CLEAN DIALECT SWAP — see [`dialects`] for the dump that shows
//! `dataflow.*` and `agen.*` ops alive alongside `sentient.*` after the conversion named for them.

/// ONE `dataflow.program_unit` AT THIS RUNG — the units it runs on, and what they run.
///
/// # 🛑 THE PER-UNIT STRUCTURE SURVIVES THE WHOLE RUNG, AND THAT IS MEASURED
///
/// ⛔⛔ THIS ISLAND'S `Program` HELD A FLAT `Vec<Op>` AND THAT WAS WRONG. `dataflow.program_unit`
/// appears in **657 of the 668** `CHECK-SENT-IR` expectations in `dcc/test/` — IBM's own statement of
/// what SentientIR looks like — including the smallest complete program they ship
/// (`dcc/test/PT/xrfbmm_int8_fwd.mlir:18`:
/// `dataflow.program_unit iter_arg : %5 -> (%2) {precision = "int8"} : {`). So a Sentient program is
/// still a set of per-unit programs, exactly as ProgIR is
/// ([`crate::islands::progir::Program::per_unit`]) and as the rung below is.
///
/// ⛔⛔ AND A FLAT LIST COULD NOT STATE WHICH UNIT AN OP RUNS ON, so it could not refuse a placement
/// the backend refuses. `Helper.cpp:2177-2179` admits an `agen.composite_load_and_store` on an L3 half
/// ONLY, with a bare `LogicalResult::failure()` and no message — dbo-opt then printed just the
/// caller's wrapper, *"Unable to generate loops and sentient statements for the composite vector
/// operations"*, and that was read as being about the transfer's shape rather than its unit. An

/// removes the row nest, `FITS_LX` the tiling loop, `STICK_ALIGNED` the mask and every
/// `element_wise_selection` that consumes it — so a program that forgot which rung it was baked for

/// versions were thrown away for, so it is worth saying rather than leaving to be discovered.
///
/// ⚠️ **TODO(quant):** a fourth parameter `Q: Quant` belongs here. There is no `Quant` trait in this
