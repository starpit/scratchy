//! `Uniform.td` — ONE PROGRAM WRITTEN ONCE AND MAPPED ONTO MANY UNITS.
//!
//! Not one of `dcc`'s own dialects: it belongs to the dataflow scheduler
//! (`dataflow-scheduler/external/dataflow-scheduler-dialects/include/dataflow-scheduler/Dialect/Uniform/Uniform.td`,
//! dialect `uniform` at `:34-41`) and its ops arrive in the DataflowIR the scheduler hands to `dcc`.
//!
//! # ⛔⛔ THE POINT OF THE DIALECT IS THAT THE PROGRAM IS **SHARED**
//!
//! `uniform.uniformize_regions`'s own summary is *"to map parallel regions to different units, aiming
//! to consolidate programs from multiple units into a single program"* (`Uniform.td:83`). A region
//! carries a LIST of units and one region argument standing for *"whichever of them is running this"*,
//! and `uniform.query_map` is how a body reads the one constant that differs per unit. So an op count
//! is not a work count: sixteen units running one region is one region in the IR.
//!
//! ⭐ IT IS THE INPUT SHAPE `FlatteningLocalRegions` REWRITES, which is why it lands here now.
//! Entries 180, 181 and 182 ask an operation WHICH op it is —
//! `isa<uniform::UniformizeRegionsOp>` (`dcc/src/Transform/Dataflow/FlatteningLocalRegions.cpp:137`,
//! `:235`) and `isa<mlir::uniform::YieldOp>` (`:229`) — and those three questions cannot be asked of
//! an island that has no `uniform` op at all. [`super::Op`]'s eighth variant is that answer.
