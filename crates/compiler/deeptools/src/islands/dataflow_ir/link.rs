//! EVERY PRODUCER-CONSUMER PAIRING, AS ONE VALUE WITH TWO ENDS.
//!
//! # 🛑 A PAIRING IS NOT TWO FACTS THAT AGREE
//!
//! ⛔⛔ THE EMITTER BUILT BOTH ENDS SEPARATELY AND TRUSTED THEM TO MATCH:
//!
//! ```text
//! let to   = computers.as_ref().map_or(lx, Units::first);   // the mover's destination
//! let from = loaders.as_ref().map_or(lx, Units::first);     // the compute's source
//! ```
//!
//! Two independent lookups. Nothing said the mover's `to` was the compute's unit, or that the
//! compute's `from` was the mover's — and if a schedule named neither, BOTH fall back to `lx` and
//! the program describes a wire from a memory to itself. Every type in this crate stayed silent on
//! that.
//!
//! ⭐⭐ SO THE PAIRING IS THE VALUE. A [`Link`] is minted once and yields its two ends ONCE, by
//! consuming itself. The producer spends the [`SendEnd`], the consumer spends the [`RecvEnd`], and
//! `Link<Lxlu, Sfp>` is a different type from `Link<Sfp, Lxlu>` — so the ends cannot be swapped and
//! a send cannot be paired with a receive from a different wire.
//!
//! # 🛑 AND THE FORM, THE UNIT AND THE WIRE ALL COME FROM THE RESIDENCIES
//!
//! ⛔⛔ `getDataTransferType(src_is_fifo, dst_is_fifo)` is TOTAL over three cases
//! (`DataTransferLowering.cpp:165-172`), and each case fixes the ops emitted, the unit kind that can
//! lower them, and whether a wire exists at all:
//!
//! | src | dst | ops | unit | wire |
//! |---|---|---|---|---|
//! | memref | memref | `agen.composite_load_and_store` (`:255, :311`) | an L3 half (`Helper.cpp:2177-2179`) | none |
//! | memref | FIFO | `agen.vector_load` + `dataflow.send` (`:274, :424`) | the LX load unit | one |
//! | FIFO | memref | `dataflow.receive` + `agen.vector_store` (`:293, :495`) | the LX store unit | one |
//! | FIFO | FIFO | *"FIFO to FIFO transfers are not allowed"* | — | — |
//!
//! ⛔ CHOOSING THEM SEPARATELY IS WHAT PUT A COMPOSITE TRANSFER ON AN `lxlu`, which
//! `Helper.cpp:2177-2179` refuses with a bare `LogicalResult::failure()` and no message at all — so
//! dbo-opt printed only the caller's wrapper, *"Unable to generate loops and sentient statements for
//! the composite vector operations"* (`:2965-2967`), and the emitter read that as being about the
//! transfer's shape.
//!
//! ⛔ AN EARLIER ATTEMPT AT THIS LOCKED THE LABEL AND NOT THE PAIRING. `Units::moves_memory()`
//! returned "is this kind an L3 half" and had NO CALLER; the emitter went on hand-placing the
//! transfer beside it. A bool that describes half of a pairing enforces nothing.
