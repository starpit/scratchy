//! THE PROGIR ISLAND — machine instructions with their registers ASSIGNED, and the program state
//! that rides with them.
//!
//! ```text
//! SentientIR ──D76 SentientToProgIR──► ProgIR ──dip-generate-init-packet──► the packet
//!                                      (here)
//! ```
//!
//! Authority: `sys-arch-spec/progir/progir.h` on the pod.
//!
//! ⛔⛔ **PROGIR IS NOT AN MLIR DIALECT**, and that is the structural fact about this rung.
//! `dcc/src/Dialect/` holds Agen, Dataflow, Sentient, Trace and Uniform — there is no ProgIR among
//! them. `SentientToProgIR` fills in a plain C++ structure, `std::map<int, ProgramAndStateInfo>` keyed
//! by core id, and the MLIR module it leaves behind holds only [`dialects::init`]'s reference to it.
//! So the ladder leaves MLIR here, which is exactly why our Rust could already meet it at the bottom.
//!
//! ⭐⭐ AND THE WHOLE THING IS TINY. `kMaxCompIBuff = 256` — *"Maximum number of instructions on any
//! unit"* — with `kMaxCompRegs = 128` (`progir.h:506-510`). A complete int8 batched matmul compiles to
//! **eight** instructions on one unit. Whatever the rungs above cost, this is the size of what they
//! produce.
