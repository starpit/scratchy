//! (`DSC2ToDataflowIRUtils.hpp:64,161`). Every unit a program's body names has to be bound by a

//! the PT reads from the west and passes its partial sum south, so its program names both.
//!
//! ⭐⭐ THE ARCH IS WHAT MAKES THE NEIGHBOURS DIFFERENT, AND THE BOUND IS THE CONST GENERIC. Row 3's

//! (`DSC2ToDataflowIRUtils.hpp:213-222`). [`PtRow`] carries that count, so the rule is written once.
