//! ⭐⭐ THE FOUR SCHEDULER STAGES, COMPOSED AND CALLABLE — `dbo/src/Utils/sdsc_bundle/SchedulerStages.cpp:29-57`.
//!
//! Campaign 6 ported 382 units of these stages and NOTHING CALLED ANY OF THEM. Every entry point
//! takes its state through trait parameters — `L3RunInputs<F, P>` / `L3RunSurgery<E, M, K, S>` for
//! stage 2a, `Dsc2Sites` for stage 2b — and no concrete type implemented them, so `F` and `E` were
//! uninhabited and the stages were dead code. THIS MODULE IS THOSE CONCRETE TYPES. Writing them is
//! the integration, not a second port: the bodies exist, this is what reaches them.
//!
//! # THE ORDER, AND WHY EACH STAGE IS OR IS NOT HERE
//!
//! 1. `sbf::doCoreletSplitSdsc` — ⛔ EXCLUDED, and not by us: `SchedulerStages.cpp:25` returns early
//!    unless `numCoreletsPerCore == 2`, and scratchy emits `numCoreletsUsed_ = 1` in all 313 sampled
//!    SuperDSCs. Recorded in `crustify-ddc/EXCLUSIONS.tsv`.
//! 2. `L3DlOpsScheduler::run` — [`l3::dl_ops::run`], `e382_run`.
//! 3. `ddc::Ddc::run_v1` — [`ddc::v1::run_v1`], `e379_run_v1`. THE STAGE THAT PLACES ADDRESSES.
//! 4. `DcgManager::runDcgForDlOpsStandalone` — ⛔ NOT WIRED, ON PURPOSE. Its body delegates to
//!    `dcg_fe/pcfg_gen/` and `dcg_be/`, both declared out of campaign 6's scope, and it fills
//!    `pcfg_[core][L3LU]/[L3SU]` — the PCFG path this project has ruled off, because our DL path
//!    emits those units directly (`bridges/superdsc_to_dataflow_ir/transfer.rs` carries 61 L3LU/L3SU
//!    references). Porting `pcfg_gen` to reach it is forbidden, so it stays a `todo!` inside
//!    `dcg::manager` and this module does not call it.
//!
//! # ⛔⛔ THE ONE STRUCTURAL FACT A CALLER MUST WORK AROUND — REVIEW 382'S OWN NOTE
//!
//! `L3RunInputs::reads` is `&'a F` and `L3RunSurgery::env` is `&'a mut E`. A shared and an exclusive
//! borrow cannot view ONE object, so the reference's single `this` is SEVERED by the port's own
//! signature — and its review says so at `l3/dl_ops.rs:20556-20560`: the placed address (`:5687`
//! writes, `:4971`/`:5034` rewrite, `:5816` reads back) and the minted tree (290/353/368 write
//! `env`; 289/295/332 read `reads`) are both chains that cross the cut.
//!
//! ⭐ SO THE TWO CARRIERS SHARE ONE STATE THROUGH A CELL, WHICH IS THE HONEST REPAIR. [`Reads`] and
//! [`Env`] are two objects, as the signature demands, each holding `&'s DscState` — and the state's
//! mutable interior is what restores the reference's aliasing. It is NOT a workaround that changes
//! behaviour: it makes the two views name the same tree and the same placed address, which is what
//! the reference does and what any faithful caller must do. Unifying the carriers in the port itself
//! is the cross-entry work review 382 names over entries 050/219/220/222/292/333; until that lands,
//! the cell is what a caller has.
//!
//! # ⛔ NO FABRICATION, ANYWHERE
//!
//! Every provider method answers from the SuperDSC it was given. `dxp_standalone` and `dbo-opt` run
//! THESE SAME FOUR STAGES over scratchy's SuperDSC today and produce a working `init_binary`
//! (`RunSchedulerOnSdsc.cpp:144-170`), so every fact these methods are asked for is already present
//! in what scratchy writes — there is no data gap, by construction. A method that cannot yet be
//! answered is a `todo!` NAMING THE TRAIT AND METHOD, never a plausible constant: a fabricated
//! placement is the failure this crate ranks worse than a stop.
