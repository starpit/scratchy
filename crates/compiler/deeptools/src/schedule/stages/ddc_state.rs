//! ⭐⭐ THE ONE `currDsc` STAGE 2B'S FOUR VIEWS NAME — [`Dsc2State`] holds every DSC's design space,
//! its `computeOp_` list and its `dataStageParam_`, and [`super::Dsc2Store`], [`super::Dsc2Reads`],
//! [`super::Dsc2Tree`] and [`super::Dsc2Stages`] each hold a SHARED reference to it.
//!
//! ⛔⛔ THE STRUCTURAL FACT A CALLER MUST WORK AROUND — [`v1::Dsc2Store::split`]. Its signature is
//! `fn split(&mut self) -> (&Self::Reads, &mut Self::Tree)`, and its own doc (`ddc/v1.rs:6040-6047`)
//! says a caller holding `struct { reads, tree }` satisfies it and warns that TWO CARRIERS OVER ONE
//! `currDsc` would make entry 308's writes invisible to entry 307's reads. So [`super::Dsc2Store`]
//! OWNS its two halves as fields — and both of those halves hold `&'s Dsc2State`, so the shared and
//! the exclusive view name the SAME tree, the SAME `labeledDs_` and the SAME compute-op list.
//!
//! ⭐ IT IS THE PATTERN STAGE 2A ALREADY PROVED, NOT A SECOND ONE. [`super::DscState`] is the same
//! shape for the L3 stage, and it is sound for the same reason: every tree and design-space trait
//! answers BY VALUE, so no [`RefCell`] borrow outlives the call that took it and none can overlap a
//! write.
//!
//! # ⛔⛔ THREE FACTS `l3::dsc` DOES NOT CARRY, AND WHY THEY ARE CONSTRUCTION ARGUMENTS
//!
//! 1. **`computeOp_`** — [`v1::PrepDsc::compute_ops`] is the FIRST provider call `run_v1` makes
//!    (`ddc/v1.rs:6437`), and an EMPTY answer makes it `continue` past the DSC. So a carrier that
//!    could not state the op list would silently skip every DSC and answer [`v1::DscFilled::Yes`]
//!    having done nothing — a false green. [`DesignSpaceConfig`] does not hold `computeOp_`, so the
//!    list is handed in, exactly as stage 2a is handed [`v1::OpFuncs`] ([`super::run_l3`]).
//! 2. **`dsc.name_`** — `dsc/designSpaceConfig.h:72`, which [`DesignSpaceConfig`] does not carry
//!    either, and which only [`v1::Dsc2Fill::said`]'s two verbose lines read.
//! 3. **`numWkSlicesPerDim_`** — a [`SuperDsc`] field, and `run_v1` takes the super-DSC as
//!    `&mut`, so no provider may alias it. It is copied in at construction.
//!
//! # ⛔⛔ AND THE ONE `run_v1` ITSELF SEVERS
//!
//! `run_v1(sdsc: &mut SuperDsc, sites: &mut P, ..)` takes TWO independent `&mut`s, so `P` may not
//! borrow the super-DSC. `currDsc` in the reference IS `sdsc.dscs_.at(idx)`; here it is a CLONE taken
//! at construction. `select_and_parse_ddl_template` writes through `sdsc.dscs_mut().at_mut(idx)`
//! (`ddc/v1.rs:6489`) and those writes do NOT reach this clone. That is a third cut of the same kind
//! review 382 recorded on `L3RunInputs`, it is in stage 2b's own signature, and no caller can close
//! it — see [`Dsc2Facts::dsc`].
