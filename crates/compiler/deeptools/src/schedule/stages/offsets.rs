//! ⭐⭐ THE THREE SURFACES ENTRY 333 READS — EACH ONE A PROJECTION OF THE LIVE `currDsc` AND ITS LIVE
//! `scheduleTree_`, not a stub.
//!
//! `fill_loop_offsets_and_addresses` (`e333`) reaches its inputs through [`DscOffsetFacts`]'s three
//! getters, and each of the three answers with one of the types below: the datastage extents and the
//! address-granularity table ([`v1::StageSizes`] + [`v1::OffsetSizes`]), the whole
//! `dscs_.at(dsc).scheduleTree_` walk ([`v1::ScheduleWalk`] + [`v1::ScheduleNodes`]), and the
//! `dsc2`/`DesignSpaceConfig` seams beside them ([`L3OffsetFacts`]).
//!
//! [`DscOffsetFacts`]: crate::schedule::l3::dl_ops::DscOffsetFacts
//!
//! # ⭐ WHERE EACH SURFACE'S FACTS COME FROM
//!
//! Every one of them is a BORROW and never a snapshot: `dataStageParam_` is REWRITTEN while stage 2a
//! runs (entries 380/351 write `sdsc.dscs_mut()`), the schedule tree is GROWN while it runs (entries
//! 290/353/368), and a copy taken before either would be stale by the time entry 333 reads it. So
//! [`OffsetSizesOf`], [`OffsetNodesOf`] and [`OffsetFactsOf`] hold `&'a DesignSpaceConfig`,
//! `&'a DscTree` and `&'a DscState` — the same objects `run` is holding — and every method below is a
//! read THROUGH that borrow, at the moment it is asked.
//!
//! # ⭐ HOW THE BORROW REACHES THEM, SINCE THE CARRIER MAY NOT HOLD IT
//!
//! `run` takes `sdsc: &mut SuperDsc` while the read carrier arrives as `&'a F`, so [`super::Reads`]
//! may not hold the `&DesignSpaceConfig` these surfaces want — a getter answering `Option<&Self::Sizes>`
//! forced exactly that. So `DscOffsetFacts`' three getters TAKE the super-DSC (entry 382's own shared
//! reborrow, the same one it puts in `L3OffsetInputs`) and hand a surface back BY VALUE; all four
//! surfaces are [`Copy`] projections of that borrow, so the DSC borrow lives at the call site and the
//! carrier holds none.
//!
//! ⛔⛔ ONE CONSTRUCTION ARGUMENT IS STILL MISSING, AND IT IS NOT A BORROW: [`OffsetSizesOf`]'s `ops` is
//! `computeOp_` in the [`v1::DscComputeOp`] shape, which [`super::run_l3`] does not take —
//! [`super::Reads`] holds [`v1::OpFuncs`], and that carries `opFuncName` per entry and nothing else.
//! `DscOffsetFacts::offset_sizes` refuses on it by name, so entry 333 is not entered until it is
//! threaded ([`super::Reads::with_compute_ops`] is the seam it lands on).
//!
//! ⛔ AND NEVER A PLAUSIBLE CONSTANT. Every method here hands back an extent, an address scale, a
//! stride or a page size that a PLACEMENT is computed from, and a fabricated placement is the failure
//! this crate ranks worse than a stop. What is still missing is named on the method that wants it —
//! `getSizeDataStageForNode` (e015/e016), `getBufferCapacityForNodePerDim` (e018),
//! `getBlockTransferSizePerDim`, `addressGranularityScalePerUnit`, `loopDistributionParamInfo`, and
//! the one `dsc2` FIELD our ported nodes drop (`LoopNode::isParametricLoop_`'s two accessors).
//!
//! ⛔⛔ AND ONE OF THEM IS NOT A DROPPED FIELD BUT AN INVENTED ONE. `AllocateNode::paddingSizes_` was
//! listed here as a sixth gap; **there is no such field**. `dsc2::AllocateNode` (`dsc/dsc2.h:974-1011`)
//! carries `PaddingFormType padding_` (`:981`) and nothing else padding-shaped, and `paddingSizes_` is
//! declared ONLY on `DataStructDims` (`dsc/dims.h:219`,
//! `std::map<PrimaryDimTypes, DimPaddingSizes>`) — so EVERY ONE of its 24 reads in `ddc/ddcv1.cpp` is
//! a read of a datastage BY TYPE, whatever the local is called (`coreDs.ss_` at `:580`, `dsChunk` at
//! `:1961-1968`, `dataStageParam_.at(denId_).ss_` at `:2437`, `ds` at `:2512-2674`). That map is
//! [`v1::StageSizes::stage_padding_sizes`], which is answered. So the gap was never a missing borrow
//! or a missing field: `v1::StageSizes::alloc_padding_sizes` described nothing and had zero production
//! callers, and has now been DELETED from the trait — declaration, two `#[cfg(test)]` doubles and all
//! three impls, in one commit, because removing any one alone is `E0407`.
