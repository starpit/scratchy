//! ⭐⭐⭐ BRIDGE 1'S SCHEDULING SEAM — the ONE surface a caller OUTSIDE this crate names, and the only
//! one it is allowed to.
//!
//! ```text
//! <a target's own SuperDSC wire form>
//!     ──the target's conversion, speaking ONLY the names below──► SuperDsc + the three stage arguments
//!     ──run_stages_2a_2b───────────────────────────────────────► Scheduling  (the SCHEDULED tree)
//! ```
//!
//! # ⛔⛔ WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS: `scratchy knows nothing about l3`
//!
//! The root `CLAUDE.md` is explicit — *"Everything common is shared. One implementation of every
//! target-neutral pass"* and *"Per-target surface = opcode lowering only."* The scheduler is
//! target-neutral by definition, so a target crate reaching into
//! [`crate::schedule::l3::dsc`], [`crate::schedule::dsc2`], [`crate::schedule::ddc::fold`],
//! [`crate::schedule::ddc::v1`], [`crate::schedule::ddc::transformation`] and
//! [`crate::schedule::stages`] — nine distinct internal paths, which is what
//! `crates/targets/spyre/src/superdsc_to_l3_sdsc.rs` did — is the boundary being absent rather than
//! declared. **This module IS the declaration.**
//!
//! ⭐ AND IT IS A BOUNDARY, NOT A SECOND IMPLEMENTATION. Every item below is a `pub use`; nothing is
//! defined here and no fact is restated. That is the point: the scheduler's internals can be
//! rearranged — `l3::dsc` merged, `dsc2` renamed, `stages` split — and no target crate changes,
//! because a target names only what this file re-exports. Adding logic here would make it a second
//! place the vocabulary lives, which is the drift this crate already paid for once
//! (`Isa::InstOperand`, 89 enumerators kept in step by a hand-written assertion).
//!
//! ⛔⛔ WHAT IT IS *NOT*: it is NOT the file relocation. The wire→[`SuperDsc`] conversion still lives
//! in the spyre crate and still speaks both vocabularies; moving it in here needs the SuperDSC wire
//! DTOs to move too, and that is blocked twice — they are `serde`/`serde_json::Value` types and this
//! crate has NO serde dependency (its `Cargo.toml` lists only `sys-arch-spec`), and two of their
//! fields are typed by `scratchy_subtile` (`SliceIndex` on `coreIdToWkSlice_`, `DeviceWalk` on
//! `AllocNode::maxDimSizes_`), which this crate may never depend on. The relocation is owed; this
//! module is what makes it a MOVE rather than a rewrite of nine import paths.
//!
//! ⛔ NOTHING HERE WIDENS `pub`. Every re-export is already `pub` on its own module, so this adds no
//! access a target did not have — it CONCENTRATES it, so that `grep deeptools::schedule
//! crates/targets/` is the audit and its answer is zero.
//!
//! # ⭐ THE TWO STAGE ARGUMENTS, AND WHY A CALLER STATES THEM
//!
//! [`run_stages_2a_2b`] takes the super-DSC plus two things that are NOT fields of
//! [`DesignSpaceConfig`] or [`SuperDsc`], so no carrier can read them off the value in hand:
//!
//! * [`OpFuncs`] — `computeOp_[i].opFuncName`, which the min-param units specialise on.
//! * `&[Vec<DscComputeOp>]` — `computeOp_` itself, POSITIONALLY beside `sdsc.dscs()`. ⛔ AN EMPTY
//!   LIST IS A FALSE GREEN: [`crate::schedule::ddc::v1::PrepDsc::compute_ops`] is the FIRST provider
//!   call `run_v1` makes (`ddc/v1.rs:6437`) and an empty answer makes it `continue` past the DSC, so
//!   the stage answers [`DscFilled::Yes`] having placed no address and minted no node.
//!
//! ⛔ THERE WAS A THIRD, AND IT WAS WRONG: a `&[StorageName]` positional beside `sdsc.dscs()` for
//! `dsc.name_`. That field IS a [`DesignSpaceConfig`] field
//! ([`crate::schedule::l3::dsc::DesignSpaceConfig::name`]), so stating it beside the value produced a
//! FABRICATED `dsc{i}` for any caller that stated none.

/// ⭐ THE DIM VOCABULARY A SuperDSC IS WRITTEN IN — `PrimaryDimTypes` (`dsc/dims.h:34`) and the two
/// extent newtypes beside it. ⛔ RE-EXPORTED HERE BECAUSE THEY LIVE INSIDE A BRIDGE'S OWN MODULE

/// needing them was reaching past a bridge's boundary as well as the scheduler's.

/// BOTH the compiler and the senulator include, and [`OpFunc::from_spelling`] is
/// `EnumsConversion::stringToOpFuncs`, the reference's own parse boundary. Re-exported here so a

// ⭐⭐ THE SCHEDULE TREE ITSELF, so a LOWERING can walk the typed tree instead of the wire's
// `nodeType_` STRING. [`Scheduling::state`] hands out a [`DscState`]; [`DscState::dscs`] hands out one
// [`DscTree`] per DSC, and that is the object carrying the nodes stages 2a and 2b minted.
//
// ⭐ AND THE TREE'S OWN TYPES, WHICH ARRIVED IN `c1f5c63fa`. A lowering that walks the tree must match
// on [`Kind`] — `ScheduleNode::NodeType` as the closed set it is — or the only thing it can read is
// the wire's `nodeType_` STRING, which is the reach-in this seam exists to remove. The two edits that
// row waited on are both landed: `pub(super)` -> `pub` on the READ surface of `stages/tree.rs`, and
// `pub use tree::{Cond, Kind, TreeData};` in `stages.rs` (whose `mod tree;` is private).
//
// ⛔ READS ONLY, BY CONSTRUCTION AND NOT BY CONVENTION. `TreeData`'s accessors are `pub` and every
// mutator — `add`, `link`, `delete`, `move_children`, every `set_*` — stayed `pub(super)`, so this seam
// cannot hand a target crate the ability to change the scheduler's tree. That is the capability twin of
// the path rule `crates/targets/spyre/tests/scratchy_knows_nothing_about_l3.rs` enforces.
