# Bridge 2 — the port list, winnowed to what scratchy's architecture needs

`DataflowIR -> SentientIR`, the D1-D28 span. **384 functions to port**, out of 490 definitions in the
span; **106 are excluded** and listed at the bottom with the reason for each.

## ⛔ WHAT THE EXCLUSION CRITERION IS, AND WHAT IT IS NOT

⭐ **EXCLUDED = SCRATCHY'S ARCHITECTURE WILL NEVER NEED IT**, not *we do not support it yet*. Three
kinds, and each is a fact about our design rather than a judgement about the function:

1. **C++ field accessors and data members (81).** `unsigned getElementWidth() { return
   element_width_; }` is a struct field in Rust. There is no function to port.
2. **MLIR pass machinery (19).** `createXPass`, `populateXConversionPatterns`, `getDependentDialects`,
   the pass context, pattern-driver configuration. `#[forward]` runs the whole pipeline at macro
   expansion — there is no pass manager, no pattern driver and no rewriter at run time.
3. **MLIR printing, parsing and verification (5).** This crate EMITS and never reads back; an island
   is emit-only and no MLIR text reaches it.

⛔⛔ **NOTHING IS EXCLUDED FOR BEING HARD, UNFINISHED, OR LOOP-DEPENDENT.** The 50 loop-sensitive
functions (22+14+14 across levels 0-2) are **DEFERRED, NOT EXCLUDED** — they stay on this list and
are ported when tiling lands and the corpus is regenerated.

⛔ **AND EVERY EXCLUSION IS LISTED, SO ANY ONE CAN BE OVERRULED.** See the bottom section.

## ⛔ THE RULES OF EXECUTION

- ⛔ **PORT means the WHOLE function, INCLUDING its emission.** A predicate is not a port. Levels 0-2
  were once reported complete when what existed was one documented predicate per function with every
  emission missing and nothing calling any of it.
- ⛔ **If our IR cannot express a function's input, ADD THE OP TO THE ISLAND.** Deciding a function is
  unnecessary is not the porter's judgement to make — that decision is this document's, above.
- ⛔ **AUDIT means line by line against the C++**: every branch, constant, attribute name and value,
  default, early return, and the order of emission.
- ⛔ **NEVER PORT ANYTHING NEW WHILE AN AUDIT IS OUTSTANDING.**
- ⛔ Unit tests come with the port; the vendor's own case where one exists (668 of `dcc/test`'s 825
  `.mlir` tests carry `CHECK-SENT-IR` expectations).
- ⛔ `cargo build -Fsuperdsc,model/granite-3.1-2b-instruct,quant/fp8-dynamic-per-channel` is the
  acceptance gate. E2E when bridge 1 lands.

## Progress

`194/384 ported; 194/384 audited`

Ported and audited: `AffineYieldOpLowering::matchAndRewrite` (`lower_affine_yield`, entry 001, in
`src/bridges/dataflow_ir_to_sentient/std_affine_to_standard.rs`), `setImmutableAddrAndIncrements`
(entry 214), and entries 002-024 — `setCoalescedBoundValues`, the six `AccessDetailsBase` setters
that establish its access state and the seven that establish its transfer state, the
`AccessDetailsAffine` constructor and its two setters (`setSubscriptsMap`, `setIndicesCoeffDict`),
and `AccessDetailsAffineComposite`'s constructor plus its time setters (`setTimeAddrMap`,
`setTimeSymbols`, `setTimeBounds`, `setTimeOffsets`, `setInterleaveGroupIndex`), all in
`src/bridges/dataflow_ir_to_sentient/agen_access_details.rs`, and entries 025-032 — the INDIRECT
(extract) pattern: `setStrides` and `has` (`agen_access_details.rs`), the two
`construct*Stmt` overloads and `insertCopyAndAddStmtsHelper` (`agen_agen_to_sentient.rs`), and
`getLoopNestLevel`, `checkIndirectMemViewForExtractOp` and `findExtractScalarOp`
(`agen_helper.rs`), and entries 033-040 — the AgenToSentient load-consumer chain
(`getLoadConsumer`, `setldtype`, `generateSetSendDestinationStmts`,
`getStoreOpFromLoadStorePattern`, `findCandidateForLowering`, `addLoadChainToDeleteList`, all in
`agen_helper.rs`) plus `isSenComponentL0LU`/`isSenComponentL0SU`
(`dfs_dataflow_to_sentient.rs`). And entries 081-088 — the Loop Mask Tree's node layer:
`LoopMaskNode`'s five delegating accessors (`getParentNode`, `getFirstChild`, `getNextSibling`,
`getPrevSibling`, `getLastChild`), `LoopMaskTree::getRoot`, and the two empty destructors
`~MaskNode`/`~LMTLoopNode` as a build-time `needs_drop` guard, in
`src/bridges/dataflow_ir_to_sentient/vc_loop_mask_tree.rs` — where the intrusive tree became an
arena, so the unchecked `static_cast` to the derived node is minting a `LoopMaskNodeId`, and
`mlir::OperationNode`'s own storage and walks sit beside them unanchored, awaiting entries
079/080/281 — and entries 106-107 have since taken it up, so the arena now carries both derived
families.

⭐ AND ENTRIES 049-056 — the six `StandardToSentient` scalar lowerings (`LowerAddIOpToSentient`,
`LowerSubIOpToSentient`, `LowerMulIOpToSentient`, the `If` shape law, `LowerConstantIndexToSentient`,
`LowerConstantIntToSentient`) in `src/bridges/dataflow_ir_to_sentient/std_standard_to_sentient.rs`,
and `OperandReuse`'s two getters (`getId`, `getAbsorbtionFlag`) in `vc_operand_reuse.rs`.

⭐ AND ENTRIES 041-048 — the `dataflow.opaque` lowering and the two SCF/Standard predicate maps:
`ExtendUnitNameToCorelet`, `isSameListOfUnits`, `isTargetL3` and `lowerOpaqueOperation` in
`src/bridges/dataflow_ir_to_sentient/dfs_dataflow_to_sentient.rs`; `getSentientCmpIPredicate`, the
`ForOpLowering` pattern registration and `SCFToSentientLoweringPass::runOnOperation` in
`std_scf_to_sentient.rs`; and the second `getSentientCmpIPredicate` in
`std_standard_to_sentient.rs`.

⛔ THE ISLAND GREW FOR 044, AS THE BRIEF REQUIRES. `dataflow.opaque` carried no `dbgName`, and the
reference forwards one into the `sentient.opaque` it creates (`DataflowToSentient.cpp:2006-2007`);
`Dataflow.td:342` declares the attribute and IBM's own input writes it
(`dcc/test/Conversion/DataflowToSentient/opaque.mlir:35`). `Op::Opaque` became a struct payload so
the lowering takes one typed input, and the printer emits `dbgName = ".."` first as MLIR's key order
requires.

⚠️ AND THAT ANSWER KEY FALSIFIED THREE PRINTER LINES IN THE SENTIENT ISLAND. `sentient.opaque` was
printing `func_name = "RECIPROCAL"` (the generated enum's spelling rather than the reference's
lowercase), `{P0 = "0"}` for the register dictionaries (the address with no `R` — `ddcv1.cpp:3350`
writes `"R" + startAddress` and `dcc/src/Dialect/Sentient/Utils.cpp:157` strips it back off by
position), and both dictionaries unsorted. All three are fixed, and `opaque.mlir:18` is now
reproduced byte for byte by a unit test.

⛔ 042 HAS NO CALLER AT `a0d29abbed`. A grep of every `.cpp`/`.hpp`/`.h` in the authority tree finds
`isSameListOfUnits` exactly once, at its own definition. It is ported anyway — this document's rule
is that deciding a function is unnecessary is not the porter's judgement — and the note on it says so.

⛔ 041'S ERROR ARM IS UNREACHABLE BY CONSTRUCTION, NOT UNCHECKED. `!unit->hasAttr("corelet")` is the
failure, and `residency_of` sends both LX halves to `Residency::Corelet { .. }` unconditionally
(`src/units.rs:594`), so the port takes a `Corelet` and the arm has no input. Both call sites
(`:409-411`, `:709-713`) guard on `dst_comp == LXLU || dst_comp == LXSU` before calling, which is what
the `LxHalf` enum is.

⛔ AND 047 CANNOT LOWER A MODULE YET, BY DESIGN OF THE SCHEDULE RATHER THAN OF THE PORT. Its three
patterns are `ForOpLowering::matchAndRewrite` (entry 225, unported), `IfOpLowering::matchAndRewrite`
(`SCFToSentient.cpp:158`) and `YieldOpLowering::matchAndRewrite` (`:241`) — and the last two are in
neither the 384 nor the 106 exclusions. The pass is wired in with a `todo!` naming the pattern that
owes the rewrite, because the alternative is leaving an `scf` op in a module the Sentient rung is then
asked to schedule. The `ConversionTarget` is a THREE-valued `Legality`: `applyPartialConversion` fails
only on ops marked ILLEGAL, and `dataflow`/`affine`/`agen` are named by neither list.

⭐ AND ENTRIES 097-104 — the conditional-tree pair (`getNewDbgNameFromList`,
`getLhsRhsOfEQPredicate`), `ConditionalSimplificationManager`'s destructor and
`CFGSDataflowConditionalTree`'s constructor in `tf_cfgs_dataflow_conditional_tree.rs`, and
`LocalOpNode`'s constructor with its three link reads (`getParentNode`, `getFirstChild`,
`getNextSibling`) in `tf_flattening_local_regions.rs`.

⭐ AND ENTRIES 105-108 — `LocalOpNode::getPrevSibling`, `FlatteningLocalRegionsTree`'s constructor
and its `getRoot`, and `partitionUnits`, in `tf_flattening_local_regions.rs`. ⛔⛔ THE FAMILY MOVED
ONTO THE SHARED ARENA HERE, which is the reconciliation entries 101-104 could not make: entry 106 is
the `: OperationTreeBase()` the C++ names, so the tree it constructs is
`OperationTreeBase<LocalOpNode>` from `vc_loop_mask_tree.rs` — as that layer's own banner instructs —
instead of a second set of links, a second `getPrevSibling` walk and, at entry 180, a second
`insertChildNode`. Entries 102-104 therefore moved from `LocalOpNode` onto the tree as one-line
delegations, exactly as 081-083 read on `LoopMaskTree`, and `LocalOpNode` is now the payload the
derived class adds (`units`, `is_in_region_num`). ⭐ ENTRY 107'S `DT_CHECK` SPLIT THREE WAYS: two
conjuncts hold by construction, and `root_ != nullptr` stays an `Option` because `flatten` really does
observe a rootless tree (`FlatteningLocalRegions.cpp:385-387`). ⛔ AND 108'S EQUALITY IS POINTER
IDENTITY — `std::vector<Operation *>::operator==` — which is what keeps the vendor's `@diff_groups`
four structurally identical bodies in four separate regions, in `MapVector` key order (`%0, %2, %1,
%3`).

⭐ AND ENTRIES 109-112, THE TWO RANGE PAIRS. `performFullUnroll` + `getConstantTripCount` in
`tf_loop_unroll_for_shuffle_op.rs`, and `getMaxMutableRange` + `getMaxImmutableRange` in
`tf_mutable_addr_splitting.rs`. ⛔⛔ 109 IS THE DECISION AND NOT THE DUPLICATION, AND THAT IS THE
REFERENCE'S OWN SHAPE: neither overload clones a loop body — the scf one reconstructs a trip count and
calls `loopUnrollByFactor(for_op, *trip_count)`, the affine one is the single line
`return loopUnrollFull(for_op)` (`LoopUnrollForShuffleOp.cpp:151-165`). Those two utilities are
upstream MLIR (`mlir/Dialect/{SCF,Affine}/Utils`), not among these 384, so `Unroll::ByFactor` /
`Unroll::Fully` name the request the function issues and `Unroll::failed()` answers the caller's one
question (`:135`). ⭐ THE THREE C++ FUNCTIONS COLLAPSED INTO ONE because an overload set over two loop
kinds IS a match on a closed set — and `llvm_unreachable("unsupported loop type")` (`:148`) moved into
`Loop::of`, where "not a loop" is an answer rather than undefined behaviour. ⛔ THE ISLAND GAINED
`scf::Op::For` FOR EXACTLY THAT REASON (its input was inexpressible: `scf.for`'s bounds are three SSA
VALUES where `affine.for`'s are maps, which is the whole reason one overload needs a helper and the
other does not), wired through `operands`/`block_args`/`regions` and the printer. ⭐ AND THE NEW
VARIANT MADE ENTRY 046's `Pattern::ForOpLowering` REACHABLE: `std_scf_to_sentient.rs`'s `pattern_for`
was total over an `scf` that had no `scf.for` in it, so it now answers `ForOpLowering` for the op the
pattern is registered under, and `walk_preorder` descends its region like every other. ⛔ AND 110 CARRIES
TWO REFERENCE DEFECTS, ONE REPRODUCED AND ONE NOT: the truncating `(ub - lb) / step` under-counts when
the step does not divide the span, and is reproduced because the factor is what the utility is asked
for; the unguarded zero or negative trip count reaches a `uint64_t` factor behind
`assert(unrollFactor > 0)`, and is refused instead (`TripCount` cannot hold one, and
`Unroll::EmptyOrReversedRange` keeps the divergence visible). ⭐ 110 ALSO REFUSES EVERY ORDINARY
`scf.for`: `arith::ConstantIntOp::classof` wants a SIGNLESS INTEGER, so `index`-typed bounds are not
constants to it — which the island already splits as `ConstantInt` vs `Constant`, and which is
consistent with the vendor's only test for this pass being affine throughout
(`dcc/test/Transform/LoopUnrolForShuffleOp/ldcvti_pattern.mlir`). ⭐⭐ 111 AND 112 ARE THE SAME
FUNCTION OVER TWO REGISTERS, AND THE REGISTERS DIVERGE BY ARCH: `EAR` is 21 bits everywhere
(`sysdef.cpp:313`, `:336`) but `EBR` is 30 on RCUDD1A and **32** from SEN1P5 (`:321-332`, `:344-355`),
so the immutable range is 2^40 on DD2 and 2^42 on SEN1P5 while the mutable range is 2^31 on both.
`Arch` gained `L3_EAR_BITS`/`L3_EBR_BITS` as `Bounded<53>` — the bound is the reference's own `int64_t`
return type, so `2^bits * bytesPerStick * 8` cannot overflow and needs no check. ⛔ THE `DT_CHECK(
is_any_of(comp, L3LU, L3SU))` BECAME `L3Half`, and the finding that justifies it is that the two halves
declare IDENTICAL `EAR` and `EBR` rows: the component's only function in these two queries is the
abort, so the type is the whole of it. ⛔ AND `cl::init(-1)` IS AN `Option`, not a negative size —
`MaxMutableSize < 0` is a sentinel test on the same variable that carries the value.

⭐ 097'S CITATION IS A CALL SITE, NOT A FUNCTION. `CFGSDataflowConditionalTree.cpp:456` is inside
`mergeConditionalBranchesInSubtree`; the function itself is `dataflow::utils::getNewDbgNameFromList`
(`dcc/src/Dialect/dialect_utils/Dataflow/Utils.cpp:167`, 19 lines) and that is what was ported —
head-plus-rest rather than a first-iteration flag, and a per-operation `Option<&str>` because the
whole name is abandoned the moment one operation carries no `dbgName`.

⭐ THE ISLAND GREW FOR 098, AS THE BRIEF REQUIRES. `getLhsRhsOfEQPredicate` tests
`cmpi_op.getPredicate() != eq`, and `arith::Op::Compare` carried no predicate at all — it printed
`arith.cmpi eq` unconditionally. `CmpIPredicate` now names the SIX signed forms
`getSentientCmpIPredicate` accepts (`StandardToSentient.cpp:36-53`, entry 048), whose `else` is
`DT_CHECK(0)`; the four unsigned MLIR forms are absent BY CONSTRUCTION rather than refused. `Compare`
had no construction site crate-wide, so emission is unchanged for `Eq`.

⚠️ AND THE EXTRACT HAD TRUNCATED 098: its bodies stop at `rhs = cmpi_op.getRhs(); return true;`, i.e.
at the half of the function that produces the answer. Ported from the authority at
`CFGSDataflowConditionalTree.cpp:519`.

⭐ AND ENTRIES 073-080 — the constant-splat port name (`constValToField`), the same-block guard
(`sameBlock`) and the use-erasing walk (`eraseOp`) in
`src/bridges/dataflow_ir_to_sentient/vc_vector_operands.rs`; the PESFP compute-fusion pass
(`fuseComputeOps`) in `vc_vector_chain_to_sentient_pesfp.rs`; and the Loop Mask Tree's walk, lookup
and node layer (`LoopMaskTree::walk`, `findNodeFromOp`, `LoopMaskNode`'s constructor and its virtual
destructor) in `vc_loop_mask_tree.rs`.

⛔ 073'S RUNTIME REFUSAL IS DEAD CODE IN THE REFERENCE, AND THAT IS WHY THE DOMAIN IS A TYPE.
`DT_ERROR` expands to `DT_CHECK_MSG(false, …)`, which THROWS (`util/dt_exception.hpp:110-121`), so
`constValToField`'s `return ""` (`VectorOperands.cpp:261`) is unreachable and so are both callers'
`if (value == "") { emitError; return nullopt; }` arms (`:284-287`, entries 166/167). The accepted
domain is exactly `{0, 1, 2, 3}` — a four-variant `ConstantOperandValue` — and the `double`
comparison chain went with it: what the chain decides is WHICH OF FOUR pseudo-unit ports
(`SentientTypes.td:100-106`) the splat is read from, not a number.

⛔⛔ 074 PROVED `kind == Constant` IS NOT `isa<arith::ConstantOp>`, AND THE TWO DISAGREE BOTH WAYS.
`getOperandFromConstantBitstreamOp` tags a `vectorchain.constant_bitstream` operand `Constant`
(`VectorOperands.cpp:305`) and the trivial-shuffle path re-tags an operand built over an
`arith.constant` as `NFWD`/`ConstantBitstream` (`:317-336`). `sameBlock` asks the OP, so the port
takes the enclosing scope as a parameter and interrogates the op class there — the precedent
`agen_helper.rs`'s entry 038 set. ⚠️ The exemption is unreachable from the one caller today:
`OperandReuse::setReuseInformation` guards with `type_ != Constant` (`OperandReuse.cpp:31`). Ported
anyway.

⛔ 075 CAN DELETE AN INNOCENT OP IN THE REFERENCE. `for (auto &use : op->getUses())` yields ONE ENTRY
PER USE, so an op that reads the same result twice is pushed to `to_be_erased` twice and `e->erase()`d
twice (`:809-819`) — a double free there, and in an arena a second erase at a stale position. The port
deduplicates, and erases in DESCENDING position order because every position a removal invalidates is
lexicographically greater than the one removed.

⭐⭐ 076 SPLIT LEGALITY IN TWO, BECAUSE `applyPartialConversion` DOES. Sixteen patterns are installed
(`VectorChainToSentientPESFP.cpp:1247-1255`) but only thirteen op classes are `addIllegalOp`
(`:1262-1265`); an op that is neither legal nor explicitly illegal is still offered to the patterns
and left alone if none matches. So `ElementWiseCompareOpLowering`, `ElementWiseSelectionOpLowering`
and `ShuffleOpLowering` DO rewrite when they match while their ops are not required to lower —
`Unlowered::Required` and `Unlowered::BestEffort` keep that asymmetry auditable instead of merging it
away, and only the required work reaches the `todo!`.

⭐⭐ 079 GAVE THE ARENA NODE AN `OpId`, NOT A BORROW, AND THE REFERENCE FORCED IT. A `LoopMaskTree` is
built once per PT program unit and then threaded through three MUTATING passes — `fuseNonComputeOps`,
`fuseComputeOps`, `lowerDanglingNonComputeOps` (`VectorChainToSentientPT.cpp:1003-1014`) — while
`insertPTMaskOps` walks it inserting `set_mask`/`incrmask` ops (`LoweringPTMasks.cpp:74-100`). A
`&DfirOp` held across those calls forbids exactly the rewrites the tree exists to drive, and
`updateNode` (entry 237) exists BECAUSE a lowering replaces the op a node names. ⚠️ This diverges
deliberately from `LocalOpNode::new` (entry 101), which took `&'p DfirOp`: that node is built, read
and dropped inside one non-mutating walk and never asked which op it holds. And `push_child` takes the
op by value rather than as an `Option`, so *only the synthetic root names no operation* is a type
rather than a comment.

⭐ 078 DROPPED THE `DenseMap` MEMO FOR AN ARENA SCAN, and the two answers coincide exactly: the map
holds an entry for every node except the root (`LoopMaskTree.cpp:152`, `:179`, while `:175` inserts
nothing) and the scan skips the root because its operation is `None`. What the map would cost is a
second source of truth for its two writers (entries 236, 237) to keep in step — which is the bug its
own `"op already in map - should not happen"` check exists to catch.

⛔ 077'S ACTION RETURNS NOTHING, AND ONE CALLER READS AS THOUGH IT DOES NOT. `kBFS` discards the
action's result (`(void)action(curr_node)`, `OperationTree.cpp:190`), so
`analyzeAndInsertMaskOps`'s `signalPassFailure(); … return nullptr;` (`LoweringPTMasks.cpp:193-197`)
does **not** stop the walk — the rest of the queue is visited and further masks are still lowered.
Only the two GUIDED orders steer by the return value, and they are unscheduled. A test pins it.

⭐ 079 PUT THE OPERATION IN THE **BASE**, WHICH IS WHERE THE REFERENCE KEEPS IT
(`OperationNode::operation_op_`, `OperationTree.hpp:185`; `LocalOpNode(Operation *op)
: OperationNode(op)`, `FlatteningLocalRegions.cpp:51`) — but entry 101 had already put it in the
PAYLOAD, as a `&'p DfirOp`. In C++ there is one `insertChildNode` because the node's constructor,
which the caller runs, has already set `operation_op_`; here the arena mints the node, so those two
constructors reach it as TWO inserts over one shared body: `push_named_child` (an `OpId` in the base,
so `find_node_from_op` can search it) and `push_child` (the base's `op` stays `None`; the payload
names it). ⚠️ A tree built through the second must not be searched with `find_by_op`.

⛔ **FIVE SCOPE HOLES FOUND IN THIS BATCH, NONE IN THE 384 AND NONE IN THE 106 EXCLUSIONS.**
- The sixteen PESFP compute-pattern `matchAndRewrite` bodies (`VectorChainToSentientPESFP.cpp:328`,
  `:569`, …) — entry 076 installs them and nothing ports them, so `fuseComputeOps` reaches a `todo!`
  naming the first pattern it needs.
- `VectorOperand::sameBlock`'s SECOND overload, over a
  `SmallVectorImpl<optional<VectorOperand>>&` (`VectorOperands.cpp:670-685`), which is what
  `VectorChainToSentientPT.cpp:142` and `VectorChainToSentientPESFP.cpp:121` actually call. Its body
  is entry 074's applied to every element — same two failure arms, one `return success()` at the end
  — so it is a fold over the ported one, but no caller can be built without it.
- `VectorOperand::eraseOp`'s SECOND overload, taking a `ConversionPatternRewriter` and an
  `erased_list` (`:829`), called from `VectorChainToSentientPESFP.cpp:1062`. It is the one that
  deduplicates — `std::find` against both lists (`:837-841`) — which is what entry 075 had to decide
  for itself.
- `OperationNode::breadthFirstWalk` (`OperationTree.cpp:183`) and the six other
  `LoopMaskNode::walk<>` specializations (`LoopMaskTree.cpp:26-93`). The BFS one is written here
  unanchored, beside the rest of the base layer; the other six orders are not.
- `LoopMaskNode`'s and `MaskNode`'s COPY constructors (`LoopMaskTree.hpp:33`, `:73`), and
  `MaskNode`'s is a reference DEFECT: `MaskNode(const MaskNode &n) : LoopMaskNode(n.getOperation())`
  copies the op and silently drops `start_val_` and `increment_`, leaving both uninitialised. Nothing
  in the tree calls it today.

⛔ **TWO HOLES IN THE VALUE-BASED SIMPLIFICATION PATH, NEITHER OF THEM MINE TO FILL.** Entry 381
(`simplifyValueBasedConditionals`) needs the manager to be constructible and parseable, and:
- `parseConditional` (`CFGSDataflowConditionalTree.cpp:534`) is excluded above under *MLIR
  printing/parsing/verification*, which is a name-based misclassification — it parses no text. It
  walks the conditional tree and fills `val_array_` with the value each iteration yields, and it is
  the only writer of the array entry 099's destructor frees.
- `ConditionalSimplificationManager`'s CONSTRUCTOR (`CFGSDataflowConditionalTree.hpp:55-76`, 22
  lines) is in no batch and on no exclusion list. Entry 099 is the DESTRUCTOR at `:78`. The
  constructor is where `is_candidate_` is decided and where `num_iterations` sizes the array, so
  without it the destructor has nothing to own.

⛔ **THREE MORE SCOPE HOLES, ALL UNDER ENTRY 261 AND ALL IN `dcc/src/Dialect/Uniform/Utils.cpp`.**
`UniformQueryMapsCanonicalization.cpp:59` calls `simplifyQueryMapWithSameTarget` (`:1263`), which is
the WHOLE of what the pass does to a query map — the pass without it only erases — and which in turn
calls `getRegionOpAndIndex` (`:343`) and `getUnitsOfRegion` (`:526`). None of the three is in the 384
or in the 106 exclusions. All three are written unanchored beside entry 261's port, the last of them
narrowed to the two region-owning ops this island carries: the reference's walk also stops at a
`uniform.equalize_pattern`, which `islands/dataflow_ir/dialects/uniform.rs` deliberately omits.

⭐ 001/384 MOVED TO ITS OWN TRANSLATION UNIT'S HOME: `lower_affine_yield` was living in
`dataflow_ir_to_sentient/mod.rs`, and `crustify/crates.json` homes `e001_matchAndRewrite` in
`std_affine_to_standard.rs`. It carries its `/// Replaces:` anchor there and `mod.rs` imports it.

⭐ ONE VOCABULARY, NOT TWO: 002's port and 022's arrived with their own `TimeDim` and `TimeBound`.
022's landed first and is the one kept — its `TimeDim` is a `u32` with an `index()` accessor and its
`kInvalid` variant is spelled `Variable`. `set_coalesced_bound_values` was rebased onto it rather
than duplicating the pair, so `MemoryOperandIndex` and `LayoutCoeff` are all 002-008 adds to the
shared vocabulary block.

⚠️ THE AUDIT OF 002-008 CORRECTED ITS OWN CITATIONS, and one of 001's. Six field references pointed at
the doc comment above the declaration rather than the declaration; `kMax`'s container use is
`AccessDetails.hpp:375` not `:377`; `coalesced_bound *=` is `AccessDetails.cpp:777` not `:772`; the
time-loop trip rule is `Helper.cpp:1815-1820`. And 001's note credited the decline to an
`AffineParallelLowering` pattern — **dcc's copy of the pass registers no such pattern**
(`AffineToStandard.cpp:198-206`); the reference's comment is upstream MLIR's, and dcc leaves the
terminator alone because `scf` is already legal in its target.

⚠️ **THE RE-AUDIT OF 001-024 FOUND FIVE DOCUMENTED CLAIMS THE AUTHORITY CONTRADICTS**, all in
`agen_access_details.rs`, and no defect in the ported code itself. (1) ⛔ **024'S PROMOTION MOVES THE
BURST OUTWARD, NOT INWARD.** `computeBurstAndGroup` scans `for (int i = time_bounds.size() - 1;
i >= 0; --i)` (`AccessDetails.cpp:798`) over a vector whose index 0 is the OUTERMOST time dimension —
`constructTimeLoops` builds loop `idx` inside loop `idx - 1` and stops at `loop_num = burst_index`
(`Helper.cpp:1807-1857`), so the burst is claimed on the innermost valid dimension first and the
promotion hands THAT dimension to the interleave group. The anchor doc said "moves the burst inward"
and the test asserted the mirror image (burst 0 → 1, group 0), a state the scan cannot reach; it now
replays burst 1 → 0, group 1. (2) `TimeOffsets`' `Default` was grounded in "`calculateTimeOffsets`'s
own `const_value` fallback" — that function has no fallback, it takes `tmp_time_offsets.back()`
unconditionally (`dialect_utils/Agen/Utils.cpp:116`); the `? … : 0` ternary at the cited lines is
`constructIteratorCoeffDict`'s, and the real ground is that `getFlattenedAffineExpr` always emits a
trailing constant coefficient. (3) `IndicesCoeffDict`'s `Vec` was justified by the producer's
insertion order — a `DenseMap` preserves none; the ordered walk is `initMASData`'s over
`ad.getIndices()` (`MutableAddrSplitting.cpp:724-737`) and the ground is positional pairing with
`indices_`. (4) The struct's wave list stopped at entry 008 while entries 009-015's seven members are
declared beside those. (5) The composite fixture cited `/tmp/ktir_ref/export/debug/dfir.mlir:78-84`,
which does not exist on this host; re-pointed at
`tests/sentient_corpus/group_0__g0_7_matmul.dfir.mlir:25-30`, with the extents it does NOT share
stated rather than implied.

⛔ **052 IS A COMMENT, NOT A FUNCTION** — `StandardToSentient.cpp:159` is the line
`// return If(lhs) {If(rhs) true_val; else false_val} else false_val;` inside
`ConstructIFRecursively`'s `and` branch, which the extractor read as a 0-line function called `If`.
What it states is the SHAPE a conjunction lowers to, and that is what `NestedIf` holds; the recursion
around it stays entry 338's. ⛔ The comment names `lhs` as the outer `if` while the code returns
`rhs_if_op` (`:175`) — the emitted nest has the RIGHT-hand conjunct outermost.

⭐ **THE THREE THAT WERE UNTICKED BY THEIR OWN AUDITS ARE NOW RE-PORTED WITH THEIR EMISSION.**
`getLoadConsumer`, `setldtype` and `generateSetSendDestinationStmts` had been reduced to documented
predicates; `generate_set_send_destination_stmts` now builds the `sentient.set_send_dst` and a test
checks the three the vendor's own golden expects, verbatim
(`dcc/test/Conversion/AgenToSentient/lx-to-sfp-bypass-1.mlir:47,55,63`).

⭐ **WHAT ENTRIES 033-040 NEEDED FROM THE ISLANDS, added rather than worked around.**
`islands/dataflow_ir/dialects/mod.rs` gained the operand/result/region/use census — `uses()` counts
one entry per USE and descends into regions, which is what `hasOneUse()` means and what a previous
attempt's shape-matching faked. `GenericComp` grew from 6 variants to the ones that are
`senCompToGenericComp`'s true image, because the port could not tell `l0lu` from `l0su` while they
folded onto one `L0`. `DfirUnit` gained `CrossPtnLink` (the fourth member of the SFP-bypass set) and
`vectorchain::Op::Rotate` (the third rearrangement the two chain functions name). `link.rs` gained
`PtRowUnit<ROW>`, `L0su`, `L0lu` and `CrossPtnLink` markers, because `dataflow.send %pt, %9` — a line
in the reference's own test input — was not constructible.

⛔ **THREE DISCREPANCIES THE 033-040 AUDITS FOUND IN THE REFERENCE**, each recorded beside the port
that carries it: `getLoadConsumer`'s comment promises a `storeOp` arm the code does not have (so a
stored load hits `emitError("unsupported loadOp consumer!")`); `generateSetSendDestinationStmts`
binds `map_op` and never reads it; `addLoadChainToDeleteList` dereferences
`*user->getUsers().begin()` on a rearrangement whose result nothing reads.

⭐ AND ENTRIES 057-064 — `OperandReuse`'s `setReuseFlag` and `dominates` (`vc_operand_reuse.rs`),
and the six `VectorChainHelper` units in `vc_vector_chain_helper.rs`:
`isSentientBinaryLogicalOp`, `getInputPrecisionFromOperand`, `getResultPrecisionFromOperands`,
`getComputePrecisionOfOp`, `hasConstantBounds` and the `merge_and_pack_type` constructor.

⭐ ONE VOCABULARY, NOT TWO (AGAIN): 057/058 landed after 055/056 and were rebased onto that wave's
`OperandTag`, `DataId` and `DataOriginId` rather than carrying a second `OperandTag` with a bare
`int id_`. The table stays keyed by the `Val` a data origin produces — the sentinel lives in
`DataId::Unassigned` and nowhere else, so `setReuseFlag`'s default-inserting `operator[]` gets the
reference's `{-1, false}` from the derived `Default`. ⛔ AND `dominance_info_` DOES NOT ARRIVE WITH
058 after all: `OpId` carries an op's path through the region tree, so `dominates` is a pure function
of its two arguments and the reference's cached `DominanceInfo` has nothing left to hold. `dominates`
takes two `OpId`s while the table takes a `Val`, which is the same split the C++ has (`Operation *`
as a position here, as a map key there).

⛔ 062's PACK/MERGE SHORT-CIRCUIT RUNS BEFORE THE ELEMENT-TYPE QUERY, and that order is the whole
function: `MergeOp` appears in neither `getVectorType` nor `getCustomVectorType` (`Utils.cpp:520-702`),
so reaching `getElementType` for one is `DT_CHECK_MSG("Type is not a known vector type")`. It is also a
DIFFERENT answer — IBM's `gcvt.mlir` packs two `vector<128xf8E4M3FN>` and the compute reads
`ComputePrecision = #sentient<precision fp16>`. `vectorchain.pack` and `vectorchain.merge` were added
to the DataflowIR island for it; the pack printer is byte-exact against `fpuop.mlir:217` and the merge
printer is derived from the `.td` and NOT byte-checked, because no vendor text writes a
`vectorchain.merge`.

⛔ AN EMPTY `affine_set` STILL HAS CONSTANT BOUNDS, and 063 must say so.
`affine_set<(d0) : (d0 - 64 >= 0, -d0 + 63 >= 0)>` admits no integer, yet its `LB` is 64 and its `UB`
is 63 — and it is the all-lanes-off mask of twenty `create_affine_mask` ops in
`Conversion/VectorChainToSentientPESFP/mixed_precision.mlir`, each lowering to
`sentient.scalar_constant {value = 0 : si64}` (`:288`, `:296`). A `LB <= UB` test in
`hasConstantBounds` would turn twenty legal masks into an `emitOpError`.

⚠️ 060/061's `fp80 -> fp8` REMAP IS UNREPRESENTABLE, WHICH IS STRONGER THAN DROPPED. MLIR's
`Float80Type` stands in for fp8 (`VectorOperands.cpp:227-232`); `ElemType` has no F80 and
`sen::Precision` has no `Fp80`, so the remap collapses into the type. `dlfp16` is dead in the
reference too — `getPrecisionInString` can only produce `int<n>`, `bf16`, `mxfp<n>` or `fp<n>`.

⭐ AND ENTRIES 129-136 — `TransformPagedMemView`'s de-paging base class and its use chains, all in
`src/bridges/dataflow_ir_to_sentient/tf_transform_paged_mem_view_impl.rs` (the file's first code):
`TPMVBase`'s three virtuals (`getUseChain`, `cloneUseChain`, `eraseMemOpAndUseChain`),
`TPMVVector`'s constructor, `TPMVVectorLoad`'s `eraseMemOpAndUseChain` override, and three
`TPMVComposite`/`TPMVVectorLoadStore` members — `getStoreOp`, `addTimeDimIndicesRanges`,
`identifyTimeDimForExplicitLoops`. 13 unit tests, built from the vendor's own
`dcc/test/Transform/TransformPagedMemView/paged_mem_view_{loads,load_and_store}.mlir` inputs. No
equivalence tests: there is no C to call.

⭐⭐ THE HEADER'S USE-CHAIN DIRECTION CONTRACT IS WRONG, AND THE TYPE FIXES IT. `TPMVBase::getUseChain`
documents *"If `mem_op` is the first element of the returned vector, it is in order. If `mem_op` is
the last element, it is in reverse order"* (`TransformPagedMemViewImpl.hpp:321-327`) — but BOTH dialect
implementations put `mem_op` first, and `VectorStoreOp::cloneUseChainToNewOp` says the opposite about
its own input two files away (*"The use chain is stored in reverse order"*, `Agen.cpp:229-230`).
Measured: `VectorLoadOp::getUseChain` walks consumer-ward (`:115-136`) and `VectorStoreOp::getUseChain`
walks producer-ward (`:207-222`), which is why their two `eraseOpAndUseChain` loops run in opposite
directions (`:176-177` reversed, `:257` as-is) to compute the SAME thing — teardown consumer-first.
`UseChain` carries the direction and `consumer_first()` is that one rule.

⭐ AND THE REFERENCE'S DEAD BRANCH BECAME THE LIVE ONE. `eraseOpAndUseChain` opens
`if (use_chain.empty()) { op->erase(); }` (`Agen.cpp:173-175`), unreachable in C++ because
`getUseChain` asserts on a non-linear chain first. Those three asserts are one question — is the
chain linear — and the header's own *"Empty if there isn't a use chain"* is its answer, so entry 129
answers `UseChain::None` where the reference aborts and then that branch is exactly right: erase the
load, leave what reads it alone.

⛔ 131 AND 132 JOIN THROUGH A SYMBOL NUMBERING, AND IT IS NOW CHECKED BY A TEST.
`addTimeDimIndicesRanges` APPENDS after `calculateIndicesRanges` on the same vector
(`TransformPagedMemViewImpl.cpp:1010-1017`), so time dim `i` lands in slot `i + num_non_time_dims`,
which is exactly the symbol `identifyTimeDimForExplicitLoops` looks up (`:967`) and the index
`addConstraintsForIVRanges` reads (`:94-102`). `NonTimeDims::sym_for` holds that arithmetic once.
⛔ The call site has TWO adjacent `int` dimension counts — `time_set_.getNumDims()` and
`subscripts_map_.getNumDims()` (`:966`, `:1024-1025`) — so the time count arrives as the `IntegerSet`
it is read off and the two cannot be exchanged.

⛔ 131'S `DT_CHECK_MSG(b - 1 >= 0, "no special time bound values should exist")` IS A TYPE. `TimeSteps`
is a `NonZeroU32` behind an `of(TimeBound)` door, so `kInvalid`, `kCoalesced` and the reachable
`Steps(0)` cannot reach the subtraction and `last_index()` is total. `IvRange` widens the reference's
`std::pair<int, int>` to `i64`: `calculateIndicesRanges` narrows an `int64_t`
`getSingleConstantResult()` into it (`:73-75`), and the constraints these become take
`AffineExpr::Const(i64)`.

⚠️ 132'S `auto it` IS A `bool`. `if (auto it = page_dependent_time_syms_.find(...) != ...end())`
binds the comparison, not the iterator, because `=` is looser than `!=`. The behaviour is the
intended one; only the name misleads. Nothing was ported around it.

⛔ **`TPMVBase`'S CONSTRUCTOR IS MISCLASSIFIED IN THE EXCLUSIONS.** It is binned as `comp_`
(`…/TransformPagedMemViewImpl.hpp:30`) under *"a one-line C++ field accessor; in Rust the field
itself"*. It is not an accessor: it is a member-initialising constructor that also seeds `mem_ops_`
with a one-element list — and `initialize()` asserts `mem_ops_.size() == 1` in all six concrete
classes (`:659`, `:707`, `:756`, `:1081`, `:1134`, `:1187`), so the singleton is an invariant that
constructor establishes. Entry 136 delegates to it, so `TpmvBase::new` exists and carries NO anchor;
the exclusion is reported rather than overruled.

⛔ **AND THE EXTRACTOR KEPT ONLY TWO DEFINITIONS PER OVERRIDDEN NAME, so ten `TPMV*` overrides are in
neither the 384 nor the 106 exclusions.** Counted in the authority: this file defines
`eraseMemOpAndUseChain` five times (`hpp:364`, `cpp:698`, `cpp:747`, `cpp:817`, `cpp:1266`) and the
campaign scheduled two (135 and 129); `getUseChain` three times (`hpp:328`, `cpp:673`, `cpp:721`) and
scheduled two (133 and 126); `cloneUseChain` three times (`hpp:341`, `cpp:678`, `cpp:726`) and
scheduled two (134 and 127); `createNewMemOp` six times over one pure virtual (`hpp:357` `= 0`, then
`cpp:684`, `:732`, `:779`, `:1120`, `:1173`, `:1242`) and scheduled one (128). Unscheduled and
unexcluded:
`TPMVVectorStore::{getUseChain, cloneUseChain, eraseMemOpAndUseChain}` (`cpp:721`, `:726`, `:747`),
`TPMVVectorLoadStore::{createNewMemOp, eraseMemOpAndUseChain}` (`cpp:779`, `:817`),
`TPMVVectorStore::createNewMemOp` (`cpp:732`) and the three composite `createNewMemOp` overrides
(`cpp:1120`, `:1173`, `:1242`) plus `TPMVCompositeLoadStore::eraseMemOpAndUseChain` (`cpp:1266`).
Reported, not filled — a `Replaces:` anchor on an entry nothing scheduled would count as coverage no
worklist asked for.

⚠️ AND FOUR OF THE SIX CONCRETE CLASSES INHERIT 133/134/135 UNCHANGED, which makes the empty bodies
live behaviour rather than fallbacks. Only `TPMVVectorLoad` and `TPMVVectorStore` override
`getUseChain`/`cloneUseChain`; `TPMVVectorLoadStore` and every composite genuinely have no linear
chain — a composite transfer's consumers live inside its own region, and a load-and-store pattern's
store is reached through entry 130 instead. ⚠️ There is no trait to dispatch through yet: entries 137
and 138 are the derived constructors, so the three virtuals are inherent methods on `TpmvBase` today
and `erase_vector_load_and_use_chain` is `TPMVVectorLoad`'s override standing beside them as a free
function.

⭐ AND ENTRIES 121-128 — the paged-memory-view transform's page-guard and use-chain layer, all in
`tf_transform_paged_mem_view_impl.rs`: `createInequalityCondition`, `setBuilderToInsertRef`,
`calculateStartElementsForPage`, `createNonPagedMemView`, `cloneMemViewIfNonPaged`, `getUseChain`,
`cloneUseChain` and `createNewMemOp`.

⛔ A MUTATED `OpBuilder &` IS NOT A RETURN VALUE, and both 121 and 122 hand one back. The reference
reassigns the caller's builder to the then-region of the `scf.if` it just built
(`TransformPagedMemViewImpl.cpp:275`) so that whatever is emitted next lands inside the guard. Here the
guard is a VALUE: `Condition` holds the per-dimension `BoundGuard`s and `Condition::wrap(guarded)`
nests the statements inside-out. 122's two arms are then `InsertRef::Conditional` (wrap) and
`InsertRef::MemOp` (hand the statements back unwrapped, for the caller to splice at the op's own
position) — no cursor, and no way to emit into a region that was never opened.

⭐ 121 IS TWO NESTED ONE-ARMED `scf.if`s AND NOT ONE `arith.andi`. The reference builds the `sge`
guard, descends into its then-body and builds the `sle` guard there, so the four values are minted
lb_const, lb_cond, ub_const, ub_cond and the SSA numbering follows. `BoundGuard` carries its
predicate rather than hard-coding the pair, because 120 (`createEqualityCondition`) is the `eq`
sibling one guard wide and belongs in this same type rather than a second one.

⛔ THE ISLAND GREW `dataflow.get_paged_logical_memory_view`, WHICH IS THIS TRANSFORM'S ENTIRE INPUT —
without it none of 123-128 had anything to run on. `PagedMemView` carries `pages: Vec<Page>`, and
`Page` PAIRS an `idx_set` with a `start_addr`, which turns the verifier's *"there should be a start
address and idx_set for every page"* into the pairing. `PageRect`'s per-dimension
`PageSpan { lo, hi }` turns both *"idx_set should be hyper rectangular"* and 123's *"expected
constant lower bound"* into the parameter type: 123 is `spans.iter().map(|span| span.lo)`, and its
test EXECUTES that equivalence against `IntegerSet::constant_bound(Lb, dim)` rather than asserting
it. The printer reproduces `DataflowOps.cpp:239-267` and is checked verbatim against
`dcc/test/Dialect/Dataflow/paged_mem_view.mlir:19-22`.

⚠️ AND THAT TEST FOUND A PRINTER DEFECT ONE LEVEL DOWN: `AffineExpr::Add(d1, -2)` printed
`d1 + -2` where MLIR writes `d1 - 2`, and that is the lower half of every page whose span does not
start at zero (`#set1` of the same file). A negative addend is now a subtraction — the same reason
`d2 * -1` was already printed `-d2`.

⭐ THE THREE ASSERTS IN 126'S WALK BECAME STOPPING CONDITIONS. `getUseChain` aborts on an op with
more than one result and on a result with more than one use; `let [res] = results[..] else { break }`
stops the walk at exactly those shapes, so the caller gets a chain that ends where the reference's
assert would have fired — which is what a chain that cannot be cloned means. 127's
`assert(isa<VectorLoadOp>(new_op))` became a parameter type instead: `VectorLoadRef` does the
`cast<agen::VectorLoadOp>` once and 126/127/128 all take one.

⭐ ONE VOCABULARY, NOT TWO (AGAIN): 121-128 landed after 129-136, in the same file, and were rebased
onto that batch's names rather than carrying a second set. Entry 129 ported the DIALECT walk
(`agen::VectorLoadOp::getUseChain`, `Agen.cpp:114-134`) as `vector_load_use_chain` because its
teardown needs the same chain — so 126, whose C++ is a cast and a forward, IS that forward, and it
answers in the `UseChain` that 133's `TPMVBase::use_chain` returns. ⛔ AND THE FORK CASE IS 129'S
READING, WHICH IS THE STRONGER ONE: a value with two readers means there is NO chain
(`UseChain::None`, the contract's own "Empty if there isn't a use chain",
`TransformPagedMemViewImpl.hpp:322`), not a chain truncated at the fork — half a chain cloned into a
guarded branch is a worse answer than none. 129's `VectorLoadOp` replaced the `VectorLoadRef` this
batch had narrowed for itself, and gained the `getResult().getType()` that 128 rebuilds the load
with.

⭐ AND THE ISLAND GAINED THE MUTABLE HALF OF ITS OWN CENSUS, for 125/127/128: `operands_mut`,
`results_mut`, `replace_uses_of_with` (one entry per USE, mirroring `uses()`) and
`clone_with_fresh_results`. ⛔ `operands_mut` EXCLUDES TWO OPERANDS BY DESIGN — a link end (`Send`'s
`to`, `Receive`'s `from`), because `link::Link` hands its two ends out once by consuming itself, and
`vectorchain::Predicate`'s mask, which carries the type it was defined at. A send's `data` IS
included, and that is what a chain clone re-points. ⛔ `clone_with_fresh_results` DOES NOT REMAP
REGIONS; both callers are region-free chain ops (`Agen.cpp:114-134`).


⭐ AND ENTRIES 065-072 — the rest of `VectorChainHelper`'s fusion and mapping layer in
`vc_vector_chain_helper.rs` (`fuseCompareAndSelectIntoMinOrMax`, `resetSentientFMAsIfExists`,
`redefineConstantVectors`, `getVectorBinaryToSentientBinary`,
`getVectorElementWiseCompareOperatorToSentientBinaryOperator`, `getVectorTernaryToSentientTernary`)
and `VectorOperand`'s two link resolvers (`getOperandFromReceiveOp`, `getOperandFromSendOp`) in
`vc_vector_operands.rs`.

⛔ 065's TWO OUT-BOOLS BECAME ONE THREE-STATE ANSWER. `bool& fusion_to_min, bool& fusion_to_max` has
a fourth state the reference reaches only to `DT_ERROR` on it; `MinOrMaxFusion` is
`NotFused | ToMin | ToMax` and the impossible pair is gone from the type. The arm order is the
reference's and it carries information: `compare_gt`/`compare_ge` with the arms in the compare's own
order is a MAX and reversed is a MIN, and `compare_lt`/`compare_le` is the transpose of that — eight
rows, all eight pinned by a table test. `compare_eq`/`compare_neq` is the one `todo!`, and it is the
reference's `DT_ERROR` at `VectorChainHelper.cpp:460-462`.

⭐ AND 065 IS UNPORTABLE WITHOUT OPERATION EQUIVALENCE, whose comment says why:
*"some times constant operands are duplicated, and direct match may result in spurious mismatches"*.
`relu.mlir` is that case — `:50-51` are two separate `dense<0.0>` constants, the compare reads `%cst`
and the selection reads `%cst_1` (`:73-74`), and it still fuses to the `max` at `:35`/`:37`.
`dcc::OperationEquivalence` (`dcc/src/Analysis/OperationEquivalence.cpp`) is not on this list, so what
landed is the minimum 065 needs: a `skeleton()` that clones an op, clears its regions and blanks every
`Val`, then compares operands pairwise through their defining ops. ⛔ IT IS BLANK-AND-COMPARE RATHER
THAN A HAND-WRITTEN PER-VARIANT TEST SO THAT NO COMPARISON CAN FALL BEHIND THE `Op` ENUM — a new
attribute is compared the day it is added. Three divergences are documented at the function: the
reference's `dbgName` filter has nothing to filter here, `IntegerSetAttr` equality is plain rather
than order-insensitive, and the equivalence-class memo is omitted.

⭐ 066'S WALK IS PROVABLY COMPLETE, AND THAT IS A FACT ABOUT THE ISLAND. `unit.walk<PreOrder>` visits
every nested operation; the Rust recursion has exactly three arms because `sentient::Op::For` and
`sentient::Op::If` are the ONLY region-carrying variants in the whole sentient island (checked across
all seven of its dialects). `si32 = -1` is `data_id: None` — the sentinel is the absence. MAC and
BINARY only: a unary or a ternary keeps its data IDs, which is a test.

⛔ 067 IS POSITIONAL REWRITING, NOT VALUE SUBSTITUTION, and that is the difference between a port and
a paraphrase. The reference clones the constant with an `OpBuilder` positioned at EACH USER, records
`{owner, new result, use.getOperandNumber()}`, and only then calls `setOperand` — so one op reading a
constant twice gets TWO clones, and a nested user gets its clone inside its own block. Both are tests.
`!use_empty()` is a real guard: an unused vector constant is neither cloned nor erased.
`const-vector-multiple-uses.mlir` is the golden — `%cst_1` is read six times at four depths in the
input (`:179`, `:184`, `:185`, down to the `multiply_and_accumulate` at `:310`) and NO `dense<…>`
survives into the expectation at `:15-24`. ⭐ AND THE SCOPE IS THE MODULE, NOT A UNIT: both call sites
pass `module_op` (`VectorChainToSentientPT.cpp:983`, `VectorChainToSentientPESFP.cpp:1385`), so the
port takes the whole `Program` — preamble and every unit. The `isa<VectorType,
dataflow::CustomVectorType>` test is discharged by the variant, because `arith::Op::DenseConstant`'s
`ty` IS a `Vector` while `Constant` is an `index` and `ConstantInt` an `i<n>`.

⭐ 068 CARRIES NO `todo!` AT ALL: `vc::BinaryOp` has exactly twelve variants and the reference names
all twelve, so its `DT_ERROR` is unreachable once the argument is a Rust enum. It is still not an
identity — `sen::BinaryOp` has twenty, the two converts, `merge`, `pack` and the four `fcmp`s having
no `vectorchain` counterpart. 069 is four arms for six inputs BY DESIGN: the ISA has no element-wise
`gt`/`ge` and the caller reorders the operands instead (`VectorChainToSentientPESFP.cpp:450-485`),
which `fcmp_select.mlir` shows both halves of — input `:136` is `compare_gt` and expectation `:48` is
`fcmp_lt` with `opA`/`opB` swapped. ⛔ 069'S `todo!` MESSAGE SAYS "Ternary" BECAUSE THE REFERENCE'S
DOES: it is a copy-paste from 070, kept verbatim so a grep for the text finds the C++ line.

⛔ 071/072 ARE THE LINK NAME, AND THE LINK NAME IS THE OPERAND. Both resolve a peer unit plus the
asking component into a `sen::Port`, and the reference's string arms became total matches over
`DfirUnit`, so a nineteenth unit has to say which arm it belongs to. `generic == PT` is every
`PtRow(_)` and `generic == CROSSPTNLINK` is one unit, both checked against `senCompToGenericComp`
(`sys-arch-spec/arch_enums.cpp:124-211`). Goldens: `loweringXRF_with_if_branch.mlir:145` receives from
an `l0lu` and expects `opA = #sentient<compute_port west>` (`:49`); `xrf_increments.mlir:413-457`
receives from an `lxlu` on a PT and expects `opC = … north` (`:71`); `xrf_increments.mlir:422` sends
to a `ptrow1` and expects `ResultForwarding = [#sentient<compute_port south>]` (`:81`).
⭐ THE ASYMMETRY IS THE REFERENCE'S: a PE/SFP may SEND to the L0 and to either LX half, and may not
RECEIVE from the L0 at all. ⛔ AND THE PT BRANCH OF 072 HAS NO `else` — an unmatched destination falls
out with `link` empty into the bottom `if (link.empty())`, whose message says *"Unsupported
destination for PE/SFP FMA"* even though the unit asking is the PT; both branches are written and the
message is reproduced as the reference words it. Two of the four failure paths in each are
unreachable from a resolved `DfirUnit` and are documented rather than written: `findUnitType`'s empty
optional is a disagreement between attributes the caller resolved earlier, and
*"Unknown receiver"*/*"Unknown destination"* is a lookup into the same table `DfirUnit::spelling`
came out of.

⛔ THE `sfpring` RE-CHECK IS A TAUTOLOGY IN THE REFERENCE ITSELF: 071's
`stringToSenComponents.at(unit_str) == SFP` sits inside `else if (record->second == SFP)`, where
`record->second` IS that lookup. And 072's `emitWarning` arm — SFP→SFP below DD1 — is unreachable on
every arch this crate builds for, which is what `supports_sfp_ring` says; it is written because it is
the function and it is where an older generation lands the day one is added to `IsaGen`.

⭐ THE ISLAND GREW FOR 066/067, AS THE BRIEF REQUIRES. Both are IN-PLACE REWRITES and the islands were
emit-only, so `dialects::vals_mut`/`operands_mut`/`regions_mut` arrived in the DataflowIR island
(`dialects/mod.rs`) as ONE total match with no wildcard arm — a new op cannot be silently skipped by
the rewriters — plus `Role` to tell an operand from a result, `ProgramUnits::iter_mut`, and a
`pub(super) val_mut` on `SendEnd`/`RecvEnd`/`Predicate` for `setOperand`. ⛔ `Predicate::val_mut`
CANNOT TOUCH ITS `ty`, so the invariant that type exists for still holds.

⭐ AND ENTRIES 137-142 — the two leaf constructors of the de-paging hierarchy and its manager, the
unit filter, and the loop-info query: `TPMVVectorLoad`/`TPMVCompositeLoad` in
`tf_transform_paged_mem_view_impl.rs`, `TransformPagedMemViewManager::run` in
`tf_transform_paged_mem_view_manager.rs`, `removeCoresCoreletsFoldsFromProgramUnit` and
`isDataTransfer` in `tf_unit_filtering.rs`, and `getDataflowForLoopInfoIfIV` in `tf_utils.rs`.
49 unit tests. No equivalence tests: there is no C to call.

⛔ 137 AND 138 ARE THE **DERIVED** CONSTRUCTORS, NOT THE CLASSES THEY ARE NAMED AFTER, which is the
same reading entry 136's anchor records: `hpp:397` is the mem-initializer `: TPMVVector(mem_op, comp)
{}`, so `e137_TPMVVector` is `TPMVVectorLoad`'s constructor and `e138_TPMVComposite` (`hpp:519`) is
`TPMVCompositeLoad`'s. Six leaf types exist because entry 139's ENTIRE content is choosing which one
to build — a single struct would make that function return the same thing six times — and the five
siblings of 137/138 carry no anchor because the extractor deduplicated them by text
(`: TPMVVector(mem_op, comp) {}` at `hpp:397`, `:415`, `:433`; `: TPMVComposite(…)` at `:519`, `:534`,
`:549`).

⛔ 137'S SIBLING DROPS AN ARGUMENT ON PURPOSE. `TPMVVectorLoadStore(Operation *mem_op,
agen::VectorStoreOp &store_op, SenComponents comp)` forwards `mem_op` and `comp` and keeps the store
NOWHERE (`hpp:431-433`); `initialize` re-derives it through entry 130's `getStoreOp` and appends it to
`mem_ops_` (`Impl.cpp:512-520`). The parameter and its fate are kept in the port, because a signature
quietly narrowed to two arguments would hide the reason entry 130 exists.

⛔ 138'S OWN INPUT HAS NO ISLAND OP, AND THAT IS RECORDED RATHER THAN INVENTED. `agen.composite_load`
and `agen.composite_store` (`paged_mem_view_loads.mlir:331`, `paged_mem_view_stores.mlir:361`) are two
of the eleven `agen` ops the island does not declare; only `composite_load_and_store` is present, so
two of the three composite leaves are reachable from a vendor test and from nothing this crate emits.
The campaign's *add the op to the island* rule was applied to entry 139's actual input — the paged view
itself, which the 121-128 wave added — and minting two composite ops no emitter produces would be the
stand-in the crate rules forbid.

⛔ 139's DISPATCH IS ASYMMETRIC AND THE ASYMMETRY IS THE PORT. Both load-and-store arms build a
`TPMVVectorLoadStore` over the **load** (`TransformPagedMemViewManager.cpp:32`, `:46`) — even the arm
that reached the pattern from the store and had to walk BACK to the load, where the reference passes
`load_op` and not the op it was handed. `Selection` carries that choice; a port that passed `op`
through both arms would type-check and de-page the wrong op.

⛔ 140's TWO FILTER FINDINGS, both recorded beside the port. `getCoreId` returns **-1** for a unit with
no `core` attribute (`DccExtContext.cpp:78-124`) and -1 is in no filter set, so a non-empty
`filter-cores-except` ERASES the HBM handle — modelled as `Residency::Global` having no core. And a
`Residency::CoreWide` unit carries `corelet = 0` explicitly while a `Residency::Scratchpad` carries
none, so `filter-corelets-except=1` erases the first and keeps the second; that is the reason
`Residency` distinguishes them. The vendor's own `core_filtering_edge_case.mlir` (32 `lxlu-CL0`
handles, `filter-cores-except=0`, one survivor) is reproduced as a test.

⛔ 142 DEPARTS FROM THE REFERENCE ON ONE VALUE, DELIBERATELY. `(ub - lb) / step` is an `int64_t` there
and its only consumer feeds it to `new std::optional<int64_t>[num_iterations]`
(`CFGSDataflowConditionalTree.hpp:74-75`), so `4 to 0` sizes an array with **-4** and a zero step
divides by zero. `Iterations` is unsigned and saturates at zero; `LoopStep` is positive by
construction. The truncating division is kept as the reference's (`0 to 7 step 2` is three, not four),
because the array the caller sizes with it is the reference's too. ⛔ Its `scf` arm is ported and not
declined: `dyn_cast<scf::ForOp>` is the FIRST cast in the body (`Utils.cpp:99`) and case 3 of
`Transform/CFGSimplificationDataflowLevel/simplify-conditional.mlir:241` is *"Same as 2. but with
scf.for instead of affine.for"* — answering `None` there would have been a port that declines the
reference's own test.

⚠️ AND A CARRYING `scf.for` FALSIFIED THE `scf.yield` PRINTER. It printed `scf.yield %3` while the
reference writes `scf.yield %20 : index` (`simplify-conditional.mlir:311`) and every `scf.yield` with
operands under `dcc/test` carries its types — the same mandatory `type($results)` the `affine.yield`
printer already carried a note about, unreachable until an `scf.for` could carry an `iter_args`.
Fixed, with the two vendor loops as printer tests, and 001's terminator test now asserts the type list.

⭐ AND ENTRIES 159-166 — the sync's destination sort and the SFP's permutation namer:
`getUnitNameFromAListOfGetUnitOp`, `areCoreletsDifferent` and `separateBasedOnDestinationUnits` in
`dfs_dataflow_to_sentient.rs`, `OperandReuse::insertIfNotExists` in `vc_operand_reuse.rs`,
`getMaskValueConstantForNonPT`, `checkValidityOfPackAndShuffleLowering` and
`getMergeTypeFromIndices` in `vc_vector_chain_helper.rs`, and `getOperandFromConstantOp` in
`vc_vector_operands.rs`. 32 unit tests. No equivalence tests: there is no C to call.

⛔ THE ISLAND GREW THREE TIMES FOR THIS WAVE, EACH FOR A FUNCTION WHOSE INPUT IT COULD NOT SPELL.
(1) `dataflow.create_group` — 161's FOURTH bucket is `dyn_cast<CreateGroupOp>` and nothing else
(`DataflowToSentient.cpp:780-782`), and its only caller branches on that list being non-empty
(`:796-800`), so without the op the port would have been the same function with one arm deleted; the
vendor writes it six units wide at `dcc/test/L3SU/sync-op-l3su.mlir:75`. (2)
`arith::Op::DenseConstant` held `one: bool`, and 166 accepts 0, 1, **2 and 3** through
`constValToField` (`VectorOperands.cpp:250-262`) with `dense<2>` real input
(`VectorChainToSentientPESFP/splat.mlir:68`) — a boolean made two of the four compute ports
unreachable, so the field is now an `i64` splat and MLIR's `%e` float spelling is emitted from it.
(3) `vectorchain::LaneMask::as_set` — 089 and 163 each reconstructed the prefix form's elided
`mask_set`, and two derivations of one set is one too many; 089 now reads it from there.

⛔⛔ 161'S `// corelet = 1` COMMENT IS WRONG AND THE CODE IS WHAT IS PORTED. The test is
`getAttr("corelet") == getI32IntegerAttr(0)`, so a destination with NO `corelet` — the LX scratchpad,
`Residency::Scratchpad` — lands in `src_dst_lx_corelet1` beside the genuine corelet-1 units, and
`lowerSyncLXL3ToLXL3` then treats that list as a corelet-1 region. The same null means `false` in 160,
where both disjuncts need an attribute; and `Residency::CoreWide` prints `corelet = 0 : i32`
(`UnitMaterializer.cpp:62-80` against `:142-152`), so an L3 half IS on corelet 0 to `getAttr` — which
is why the `substr(0, 2) != "l3"` prefix test has to be decided first.

⛔ 163 EMITS NOTHING AND THAT IS THE REFERENCE'S OWN SPLIT: the `sentient.scalar_constant` is created
by the header template `getMaskValueForNonPT` (entry 229, `VectorChainHelper.hpp:114-125`), which owns
the builder. Its answer is always 0 across the corpus — every one-dimensional `mask_set` a
`create_affine_mask` carries in the 825 `.mlir` files is the all-lanes-live
`(d0 - N >= 0, -d0 + (N-1) >= 0)`, so `from_slice` is one past the last slice and the range is EMPTY
(`fnms_with_cast.mlir:11-12`, `:20`). ⛔ WHICH IS WHY `from_slice` MUST NOT BE UPPER-BOUNDED: refusing
`64 / 8 == 8` would refuse every mask IBM writes. A negative `lb / lanes_per_slice` wraps through
`unsigned` there and answers 0, reproduced as 0; a `to_slice` past the eight-bit slice mask is `1 << i`
out of range and is declined, which no mask in the corpus reaches. ⛔ AND THE MASK **PARAMETER** IS
IGNORED ON THIS SIDE where the PT folds it in — `fold_mode_df.mlir:92` carries a `%c0` this path never
reads.

⛔⛔ 165'S TABLE ORDER IS LOAD-BEARING AND IBM'S OWN TEST PROVES IT. `pack0` and `pack16` have
IDENTICAL rows (`VectorChainHelper.cpp:374`, `:383`) and the scan returns the FIRST match, so `pack16`
is unreachable: `dcc/test/SFP/merge_and_pack.mlir:232` writes a pack it NAMES `%pack16` and the
reference lowers it to `binary_operator pack0`. So the 34 rows are a `Vec` and not a map, and all 34
are pinned as one golden against that file's ordered `CHECK-SENT-IR`. ⭐ `scale` is why one table
serves four element widths, and a row holding `-1` cannot widen; the checksum filter applies only at
`scale == 1`; `repetition` is a member DEFAULT of eight that no row overrides (`:310`).

⭐ 164'S OUT-PARAMETER BECAME A TYPE, WHICH IS WHAT 165 AND 277 TAKE. `ValidPackIndices` can only be
minted by the four gates passing, so the checked list cannot be swapped for another on the way to the
scan, and `DT_CHECK_MSG((pack_op || shuffle_op))` is discharged by the `PackOrShuffle` witness.
⛔ `index > 2 * (int)indices.size()` is STRICTLY greater, so `index == 2 * size` is admitted; that is
reproduced and noted, and nothing downstream indexes with these.

⚠️ 160 HAS NO CALLER AT `a0d29abbed` — a grep of the authority tree finds the symbol once, at its own
definition; its neighbours decide the corelet split inline or through 161. Ported anyway, as 042 was.

⭐ AND ENTRIES 175-182 — `updateYieldArgs` in `vc_lowering_xrf.rs`; `opHasSideEffect` and
`mergeShallow` in `tf_cfgs_dataflow_conditional_tree.rs`; `CanonicalizeToggleDataflowPass::
runOnOperation` in `tf_canonicalize_toggle.rs`; and the Flattening tree's `clear`, `traverseRegion`,
`inRegionEmpty` and `cloneOpsForRegions` in `tf_flattening_local_regions.rs`. ⛔⛔ THE ISLAND GAINED A
WHOLE DIALECT HERE, AS THE BRIEF REQUIRES: `uniform.uniformize_regions` is the op this entire pass
family is about, and it was inexpressible. `islands/dataflow_ir/dialects/uniform.rs` declares its four
ops — `uniformize_regions` with a `LocalRegion` per arm (a unit list, a block argument and a body),
`yield`, `def_immutable_mapping` and `query_map` — as the eighth `dialects::Op` variant, wired through
`operands`/`results`/`regions`/`block_args` and the printer, and answered in 22 census arms across the
bridge. Every one of those arms is a `dyn_cast` in the reference that a `uniform.` op fails, and each
carries the reason it fails rather than a catch-all.

⛔⛔ 180 AND 182 ARE THE FLATTENING ITSELF, AND 182 IS WHERE THE BINDER MOVES. `traverseRegion` walks a
local region attributing every operation to every unit and stamping its parent's region index;
`cloneOpsForRegions` then rebuilds ONE equivalence class's body, dropping the nested
`uniform.uniformize_regions` and splicing in the operations of whichever of its regions belongs to that
class (`:235-238`). ⛔ THE REGION AN OPERATION CAME FROM HAS TO BE FOUND BY POINTER IDENTITY, NOT BY
`is_in_region_num`: `compute` stamps `false` — 0 — for EVERY region of a uniformized op (`:164`), so
the field cannot tell region 1 from region 0, and `:250-251` asks the parent which of its bodies holds
this operation instead. That is what lets `uniform.query_map(map:%285, key:%arg48)` come out reading the
NEW region's block argument (`flatten_local_region4.mlir:757` becomes `:355`), which is the whole point
of the pass. ⭐ AND `if (block.empty()) block.erase()` (`:269`) IS AN EMPTY `Vec` HERE, because the
island already records a blockless region as an empty `else_body` — the vendor's own flattened
`scf.if` at `:353-357` prints no `else`, so the case is live rather than theoretical.

⛔ 180 ENDS AT A `todo!` NAMING ENTRY 247, ON THE REFERENCE'S OWN `isa<>`. `traverseRegion` hands a
nested `uniform.uniformize_regions` to `compute` (`:137-138`), which is entry 247 at level 2 and
unported; the walk therefore refuses exactly the input the reference routes elsewhere, and every region
of fixtures 1-3 and fixture 4's outer region walk completely. Same shape as 178, whose one rewrite is
`DuplicateReusedToggle`'s pattern at level 6: the driver is ported, the `todo!` names the entry that
owes the rewrite, and it is gated on the real match condition so a program with no reused toggle is a
checked no-op.

⛔ 181 HAS NO CALLER ANYWHERE IN THE AUTHORITY TREE, AND THE REASON IS A DEFECT WORTH RECORDING. It is
declared (`:88`), defined (`:214`) and referenced nowhere else. The place that wants it is `:269` — is
this region empty — and it would have answered WRONGLY there, twice over: `is_in_region_num` is 0 for
every local region's children (`:164`) so a full region reads empty, and the predicate cannot see the
unit-class filter at `:233` that decides what actually gets cloned. Ported anyway, per this document's
rule that deciding a function is unnecessary is not the porter's judgement, with a test that pins the
wrong answer rather than a port that quietly corrects it.

⭐ THE ISLAND ALSO GAINED `Values::clone_without_regions` (MLIR's `Operation::cloneWithoutRegions`),
`scf::Op::If::results` and `affine::Op::If::dbg_name`. The result list is not cosmetic: 177 keeps the
DESTINATION's terminator when `dst->getNumResults() != 0` and the source's otherwise (`:420-428`), its
caller picks which of two candidates is the destination by the same question (`:237-247`), and
`areShallowlyMergeable` declines outright when both bind something (`:348`) — three decisions that a
census answering "none" for every `scf.if` would have made constant. And the `dbgName` on an
`affine.if` is there because `mergeShallow`'s candidates are `isa<affine::AffineIfOp, scf::IfOp>`
(`:34`), so an `affine.if` reaches `setDbgNameAttr` on the same path.

⛔ AND `UNITS.tsv`'s CALLEE COLUMN IS WRONG FOR FOUR OF THESE EIGHT. 175's is `-` because the extract
truncated the body one line early, at `setOperands`, dropping `return getXrfValue(yield_op, idx)` — so
the real edge is 175 → 090, and the tail is the half that makes the function a function rather than a
mutation. 178's is `e001_matchAndRewrite`, but `AffineYieldOpLowering` has nothing to do with this pass;
the pattern it adds is `e350_matchAndRewrite`. 177's names `e052_If`, which `mergeShallow` does not
call. 180's is `-` although the body calls `compute` at `:138`. The ports follow the authority, not the
column.

⚠️ AND ONE OF THIS BATCH'S OWN TESTS PASSED FOR THE WRONG REASON BEFORE IT PASSED FOR THE RIGHT ONE.
182's case-4 test built its `Values` counter at zero, so the clone minted `%4` while the fixture it was
cloning still read the ORIGINAL `%4` — printing `%4 = arith.subi %2, %4`, which looks exactly like a
clone correctly reading a value from outside the region. It was caught by reading the output rather than
the assertion, and the fixture now starts its counter past the program (`values_past(300)`), which is
also why the pinned text can be read against `flatten_local_region4.mlir:345-358` line for line.

⭐ AND ENTRIES 191-198 — `calculateFullShift` and `calculateDimWeights` in
`tf_mutable_start_addr_shifting.rs`; `ProgramUnitsReductionPass::matchUnits` in
`tf_program_units_reduction.rs`; `analyzeLoop` and `transformLoop` in
`tf_transform_loop_to_legalize_for_sentient_lowering.rs`; `TransformPagedMemViewPass::runOnOperation`
in `tf_transform_paged_mem_view.rs`; and `calculateIndicesRanges` and
`createConditionsForHyperRectSubscripts` in `tf_transform_paged_mem_view_impl.rs`.

⛔ 191'S TERNARY IS NOT A BOUNDS CHECK, AND ITS CONSTANT COLUMN IS NOT A LITERAL IN THE SUBSCRIPT.
`coeffs.size() != num_dims ? coeffs.back() : 0` (`:478`) reads like an index guard; the flattened row
is `num_dims + num_syms + num_locals + 1` wide, so it is longer than `num_dims` for every expression
that flattens at all and the `: 0` arm is dead. What the guard shields is FAILURE — a non-affine
subscript leaves `coeffs` EMPTY and `coeffs.back()` is then undefined behaviour. The island gained
MLIR's flattener for this (`AffineExpr::flatten` and `FlatAffineExpr` in `islands/dataflow_ir/ty.rs`,
`getFlattenedAffineExpr`), which names the constant column instead of counting the row's width: it is
the whole reason 191 cannot pattern-match an `Add` against a literal, because `(d0 + 5) floordiv 8`
has a 5 in it and a constant column of ZERO, and shifting 5 out of it would move the start address
eight times too far. The locals carry what they stand for, so `(x floordiv 2) + (x floordiv 2)` is ONE
column of coefficient 2 — a difference an enclosing `mod 2` can see.

⛔⛔ 195'S `ub_const.value()` IS SAFE ONLY BECAUSE 194 ORDERS ITS TESTS THE WAY IT DOES. The three
`getDefiningOp<arith::ConstantIndexOp>()`s at `:417-421` are read with no null check, and an `scf.for`
whose bound is an `arith.select` would fault there — it cannot arrive, because `analyzeLoop` tests
`!constant_bounds` at `:340-343` and the register file only at `:347-390`, so a non-constant `scf.for`
on a unit that owns one leaves as `KSplitParent` and never reaches `KUnroll`. ⭐⭐ THE VENDOR PROVES IT
ON AN INPUT WHERE BOTH TESTS MATCH: `dyn-loops-cond-bound.mlir` runs on `ptrow0` with an
`arith.select` bound whose induction variable is read by a store on `pt_lrfreg`, and the expectation
is an `scf.if`, not an unrolled loop. ⭐ `KSplitParent` is therefore `scf.for`-only —
`!constant_bounds && !affine_non_const_maps` is `!cb && cb` on the affine path — and 195's
`affine.for` arm for it is unreachable rather than merely unused.

⛔⛔ AND 198'S `num_dim_vars++` RUNS BEFORE THE `continue`, which is what makes the new subscripts map
renumber correctly for a dimension whose selected range is the whole range: the position is spent
whether or not a condition is emitted for it. `getConstantBound(LB/UB, dim)` there is a bound on the
loop ITERATOR, not on a view axis — `page_sel_constraints` is the page set with its dimensions
replaced by the symbol-form subscripts map's results, one symbol per iterator — which is why
`arg1 * 3` confined to `[0, 1]` prints `cmpi eq %arg1, 0` in
`paged_mem_view_loads.mlir:45-56`, and why the reference's two-field skip test is a single `==` on two
values of the same kind here. ⭐ 197 REUSES ENTRY 142 rather than re-walking the nest, and 142 is
STRICTER than the reference's own walk — it requires the value to BE the induction variable, so a
carried `iter_arg` answers "not an IV" — and it appends, because the time dimensions follow at
entry 131.

⭐ AND ENTRIES 151-158 — the AgenToSentient helpers for the composite regions, the extract-scalar
pattern and the SAMV: `checkCompositeRegion`, `checkStoreOpFromExtractPattern`,
`isLoadAndExtractScalarPattern`, `isReceiveAndExtractScalarPattern`, `updateSymbolicAccessDetails`,
`getStoreProducer`, `constructSetActiveMaskValueOp` and `createUniformizeRegionsOp`, all in
`agen_helper.rs`.

⛔⛔ 157'S `numvalidentry` IS TWO COUNTS IN ONE FIELD AND A FULL COUNT ENCODES AS ZERO. The inner
dimension's valid count is shifted by the bits the outer needs (or the reverse when the cross-slice
mask is the inner one), and both counts are rewritten to 0 when they equal their own width
(`Helper.cpp:2681`, `:2708`) — so the field never has to hold the width, and reading it as a plain
count would place the mask a whole dimension out. ⭐ THE VENDOR'S FIVE CASES ARE THE TEST:
`set_transfer_mask_state.mlir` gives `numvalidentry`/`sliceid_xsl`/`xslinner`/`wsllen` for three
generic maps and the two degenerate ones, and all five are asserted. The three-pattern
`slice_mask_map` enum is what types away `isUnmask`, `isFullMask`, `isGenericSAMV`, `getSliceIDXsl`
and the reference's four mask-attribute `DT_CHECK_MSG`s; the reference also computes `mask_wsl_elems`
and never reads it (`:2648`).

⛔ 155 NEEDS AN OPERATION MAPPING, NOT JUST A VALUE ONE. `ir_map.lookupOrDefault(ad.getOp())` answers
with the clone because `Operation::clone(IRMapping&)` records `map(this, newOp)` — so `OpMapping`
joins `ValueMapping` in `agen_helper.rs`, keyed by address as the C++ keys on `Operation*`. This is
also what promoted `AccessDetailsSymbolic` to carry its `AccessDetailsBase`: five of the six handles
entry 155 rewrites live on the base, and `mem_ref_` had no field at all.

⛔ 151 TAKES THE TERMINATOR'S OPERANDS BESIDE THE REGION. The island's `agen.yield` is a unit
variant, and 151's store arms ask what the region YIELDS (`hasOneUse` against the yield, at
`Helper.cpp:283-288`) — so `yielded: &[Val]` is passed alongside the body rather than reshaping the op
at twenty match sites. Its load arm's send_data check is unreachable in the reference itself and gets
no outcome, on the precedent entry 031's `ViewStart` set.

⛔ TWO ISLAND GAPS ARE RECORDED RATHER THAN STOOD IN FOR, both in 156: there is no
`vectorchain.coalesce`, so the coalesce-store arm and its *"must be preceded by
dataflow.receiveOp."* have nothing to match, and no `dataflow.create_multicast_group`, so two of the
four producer classes its `DT_CHECK` accepts cannot arrive. Each outcome exists and carries the
reference's message; neither is given a substitute op. 158'S `"active"` ATTRIBUTE IS NOT IR — it is
set, searched for backwards from the loop and removed by the last region, all within the pass, so it
is a field on the returned record instead of an attribute on the emitted op.

⭐ AND ENTRIES 206-213 — the chunking and shuffle info, the affine record's own initialization, the
container's two accessors, and the four `Helper.cpp` gatekeepers: `constructChunkAndShuffleInfo`,
`initialize`, `emplace_insert`, `getFirst` (all in `agen_access_details.rs`),
`checkBasicConditions`, `processInterleaveOp`, `gatherAffineLoadStoreDetails` and
`constructImmutableAddress` (all in `agen_helper.rs`).

⛔⛔ 206 WORKS ON A ROW-MAJOR **COPY** AND ITS TWO CURSORS START AT `-1`. A column-major layout is
reversed all but its trailing constant term, and the extents with it (`AccessDetails.cpp:111-123`),
while the members keep their own order. The `chunk_dim_idx`/`chunk_stride_dim_idx` pair is
`Option<usize>` here, and the legality test the reference indexes with one (`:191`) is skipped when
there is none — observably the same, because `chunk_stride` is 0 in exactly that case and its `&&`
fails. `dim == 0`'s multiplier is `INT32_MAX` verbatim (`:147-149`); a zero stride divides by zero
there, and with no ratio the extent has nothing to fit under, so it lands on the reference's own
*"Extent in load/store set is larger than from the layout"*.

⛔ 212 PUTS THE SAME START ADDRESS IN **TWO** CONTAINERS (`Helper.cpp:570-573`) — `mutable_addrs`,
which entry 357 rewrites, and a local copy entry 213 then reads as `updated_mem_view_start_addrs` —
and 213'S TWO ARMS DO NOT READ THE SAME WAY: the L3 arm reads the record, the other indexes
`updated_mem_view_start_addrs[i]` BY POSITION (`:1229`), which is in range only because of the size
test above it and means the same thing only because 212 filled both containers from one walk. 212's
coefficient rows are zero-filled as each iterator is first seen and written at column `i`, so a
column means "record `i`" even for an iterator the earlier records never mentioned.

⛔ ONE `todo!` IS ADDED, AND IT IS GATED ON THE ONE INPUT ENTRY 357 PROVABLY LEAVES ALONE: with no
access details, `generateAffineAddressManipulationStmts`' own `DT_CHECK` holds trivially, both of its
loops (`Helper.cpp:698`, `:771`) run zero times and it returns `success()`. Every other input reaches
statements this port does not have, and no stand-in op is substituted for them.

⛔ NINE OF THE REFERENCE'S TWELVE `agen` TRANSFER CLASSES AND `agen.composite_memory_interleave` HAVE
NO ISLAND OP. 210 is handed a `CheckedOp` (any DataflowIR op, or the already-lowered
`sentient.receive_and_store` whose only readable state is the mark) and 211 a `MemoryInterleave` (the
`granularity` attribute and the region's ops), on the precedent of `IndirectMemView` and
`UniformizeSource`; both matches are total and neither invents an op. 211'S IDENTITY TEST IS THE OP
**NAME** (`:361`, `:380-381`), not the attributes, so a region holding a `load_and_send` beside a
`receive_and_store` with matching burst and count is still refused — and its granularity default is
the maximum and is never checked, so `l3BurstSize` itself is legal and 0 is not.
