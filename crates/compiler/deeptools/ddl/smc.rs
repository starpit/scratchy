//! Parser for `opaque_templates/*.smc` — the opaque ops' bodies, and ISLAND 2'S OTHER SOURCE.
//!
//! A `ddl.opaque` names an op (`op="RECIPROCAL"`) whose body is one of these files. They are already written at
//! the machine's level — `FMA`, `LOGICAL`, `IME`, `SHR`, `SETMASK` with `src0=` / `tgtrf=` / `imm=` fields —
//! but against VIRTUAL registers (`p0_0`, `t4_0`, `c1`, `in0`), which is exactly island 2. So this text does
//! not get lifted to `computetype`; `computetype` gets lowered to meet it.
//!
//! ⛔ `///instr_count:N` IS IGNORED, and it is worth saying why because it reads like a length. IBM uses it for
//! an IBUFF CAPACITY ESTIMATE (`InstructionEstimation.cpp:453-482`) and never compares it against the body it
//! heads, so it has drifted: `idx32toaddr` says 100 for a 44-instruction body and `exp` says 13 for 14. It is
//! neither the length to emit nor a fact to check against, so it is not parsed.
//!
//! # ⭐ A BODY IS A TEMPLATE, AND ITS HOLES LOOK LIKE VALUES
//!
//! `mode=prec` does not state a precision, it says "the op's precision goes here". Same for `unroll=unroll`,
//! `be=be`, `imm=l0`, `src0=in0`. So a slot's right-hand side is classified HERE, at the parse boundary, into
//! [`SlotValue::Stated`] or [`SlotValue::Hole`] — leaving it for later is how a hole reaches an island and some
//! reader treats it as a value. Each hole's evidence is on [`SlotValue`].
//!
//! Build-only, like the rest of `ddl/`: its `String`s cannot reach an island because this file is compiled into
//! `build.rs` and not into the library.
