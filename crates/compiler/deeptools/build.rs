//! This is the ONE place text exists. Parsing text is the only thing in this crate that cannot be a

//! Everything emitted is derived from the templates, never listed by hand: the statement-kind set IS
//! the census of `ddl.*` mnemonics across `ddl_templates/*.ddl`, and the program set IS the census of
//! `opFuncName=` — so adding a template grows the tables and a stale hand-written list cannot drift
