//! Phase 3: read `config.json` files from a `crates/models/arch/configs/<arch>/`
//! directory into a `Vec<ModelParams>`.
//!
//! Each `ModelParams` has:
//!   - a `name` (file stem, normalized to a Rust identifier) used
//!     by downstream codegen to name the emitted specialization;
//!   - a `bounds` map of every top-level integer field in the JSON.
//!
//! The bounds map is populated purely from the JSON — no
//! per-architecture knowledge lives here. Downstream passes
//! (shape inference, CFG, codegen) decide which of those bounds
//! they care about by name (`num_hidden_layers`, `hidden_size`,
//! ...). That keeps this pass generic across architectures.

// This module is Phase 3's deliverable. Consumers land in Phase 4
// (shape inference resolves symbolic shapes using these bounds);
// removed then.
