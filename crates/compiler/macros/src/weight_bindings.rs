//! THE model's weight binding, derived ONCE from the shared tape.
//!
//! Which tensors a model needs, what kind each is, and which layer it belongs
//! to are facts about the MODEL, not about a target. They are already carried,
//! target-agnostically, by the artifact both backends lower:
//! `LoweredDecode.bindings` (`SourceBinding::Weight { id, index }`) plus the
//! op that consumes each binding.
//!
//! This walk reads exactly that and nothing else — no instruction stream, no
//! kernel ABI — so every target gets the SAME answer and a new
//! target inherits it by construction rather than by re-deriving it.
//!
//! ⛔ WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL. Without it the accessor set had two producers and
//! both were target-locked: instruction selection (cuda's solver) and metal's
//! instruction-stream bridge. Under spyre both are empty, so the emitted
//! `Weights` struct carried NO weight fields — verified in generated output:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! pub struct Weights { pub rotary: RotaryCache }   // that is all
//! ```
//!
//! and the spyre worker consequently re-found all 362 granite tensors at
//! RUNTIME by string-formatting `"{disk}.weight"` off a JSON manifest. That
//! string rule cannot express a bare `nn.Parameter` (gemma-4's `layer_scalar`,
//! which has no `.weight` suffix) or a non-default decoder root
//! (`model.language_model`), which is why gemma-4 could not run on spyre. The
//! fix is not a better string rule; it is emitting the fields at all.
