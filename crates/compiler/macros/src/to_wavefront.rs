//! PD-wavefront task **T2b** — the macro→wavefront bridge.
//!
//! Translate a *solved* decode FUF (`Fuf` + solver [`Assignment`]) into a
//! [`scratchy_subtile::lower::LoweringInput`] and hand it to
//! [`scratchy_subtile::lower::lower`], so a real Llama-3.2-1B forward
//! flows through the host-validated subtile pipeline (DAG eval + tape
//! player + wavefront scheduler).
//!
//! This is the one piece that *cannot* be `cargo test`-ed on a Mac (the
//! macro crate's test suite is cuda-coupled), so it is kept deliberately
//! thin and mechanical: every structural decision it makes — embed
//! becomes a read-only `Source`, `rope_append` splits into a Q-side
//! `RopeRotate` + a K-side `RopeAppend` (the GPU cache-write) with the
//! un-roped V aliasing the V-proj output, `attention` reads the prefix KV
//! cache as `Source` segments + the new token as `Sub` edges, `lm_head` is
//! the result — is mirrored exactly
//! by the Mac-testable `full_forward_bit_exact` test in
//! `scratchy_subtile::lower`. The bridge resolves shapes and wires
//! edges; the decomposition *semantics* it targets are already proven
//! bit-exact vs `cpu_golden` there.
//!
//! Coarse granularity (one subtile per op) per the plan: split-K /
//! N-block tiling and the inter-op slicing it needs are layered on at
//! the scheduler, not here.
//!
//! Scope: the Llama-3.2 decode op set (`Embed`, `RmsNorm`, `Gemm`,
//! `RopeAppend`, `Attention`, `Silu`, `Mul`, `Add`). Anything else
//! (MoE, MLA, sliding-window / interleaved rope, vision, TP collectives)
//! is surfaced as [`BridgeError::UnsupportedOp`] — never silently
//! skipped. The drive treats any error as "no wavefront lowering for
//! this model" and continues; this never gates a normal build.
