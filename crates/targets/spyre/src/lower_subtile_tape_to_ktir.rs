    // MEASURED, granite-3.1-2b on the card: main's decode bundle places rmsnorm scratch for tids
    // {448, 458, 1128}; ours placed {448, 458}. t1128 is the FINAL `model.norm` — the lm-head tail,
    // which lives in the SUFFIX bundle. Every other placement and every segment but seg0 was
    // byte-identical to main; seg0 was short by exactly one rmsnorm's five scratch buffers
    // (Sq16 4096 + Xn 4096 + Mean/Meps/Rinv 128 each = 8576 B at m=1, and 67 sticks × (3n − 2) across
    // the whole ladder).
    //
    // WHY, and it is an ORDERING fact, not a lowering one. `subtile→superdsc` declares a synthetic
    // intermediate during the TAPE WALK — main's `lower_rmsnorm_node` calls `assemble_rmsnorm`, which
    // calls `BundleLayout::synth`, for prefix, body AND suffix nodes alike — so its layout is complete
    // before the first `emit_bundle`. On this path the producer emits only a KTIR program, and
    // `assemble_rmsnorm` runs LATER, in the consumer (`ktir_groups_via_superdsc`), once per bundle.
    // `emit_bundle` then does `layout.map(bake_layout)` right after lowering ITS OWN ops, and codegen
    // emits prefix → body → suffix. So the BODY's snapshot — which is the layout the RUNTIME loads,
    // sizes its segments from and resolves every address through — held the prefix's and the body's
    // synths and none of the suffix's.
    //
    // The suffix's descriptors were built against the suffix's own later, complete snapshot, so they
    // address seg0 past the extent the runtime allocated from the body's. That is a DMA to an address
    // with no IOMMU translation behind it on the very first forward (the suffix runs in every one),
    // which the card answers with a response block carrying `status=Error`, reported as
    // `scheduler rejected submission` and then a bare `predict: sync rc=-1` naming no operand. It is
    // also why a descriptor-footprint audit beside the emitter was silent: at the moment the suffix's
    // ops were checked, the suffix's own snapshot did contain them.
    //
    // ⭐ THIS DECLARES, IT DOES NOT EMIT. `BundleLayout::synth_bytes` is first-one-wins, so running
    // the consumer over prefix → body → suffix here fixes every synthetic's offset in the SAME order
    // the tape walk would have, and the real pass in `ktir_groups_via_superdsc` finds each one already
    // declared and resolves the identical address. The symbol counter and the fp8-quantize set are
    // throwaways because only the layout is wanted; the descriptors are dropped.
