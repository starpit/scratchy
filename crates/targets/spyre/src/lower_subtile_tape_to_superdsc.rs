//! Lower a [`SubtileIR`] to an **IBM Spyre SuperDSC (SDSC) bundle** — the
//! TILE-LEVEL, work-divided IR that DeepTools' backend (`dxp_standalone
//! --bundle`) compiles into a device program. This is the PERFORMANCE path:
//! unlike the high-level sengraph emitter ([`lower_subtile_tape_to_sengraph`]),
//! which hands DeepTools an op-graph and lets `CompileGraph` derive the
//! per-core split automatically (on-card PROVEN to leave the 32 cores idle —
//! `SENCORES 1→14.4ms vs 32→9.9ms`, only 1.45×), the SuperDSC emitter OWNS the
//! 32-core work-division itself (exactly what torch-spyre's Inductor front-end
//! does). SubtileIR is already tile-level, so this is a tile→tile lowering.
//!
//! GROUND TRUTH: the DeepTools scheduler test fixtures
//! `/project_src/deeptools/dcg/dcg_fe/scheduler/test/sdsc_{add,bmm_autoBuffer,
//! …}.json` (on the pod) are real, valid SuperDSC; this module mirrors them
//! field-for-field. Ingest PROVEN on-card 2026-06-25: `L3DlOpsScheduler_standalone
//! -s <sdsc>.json` → "Success!" EXIT 0. See memory `superdsc-emitter-design.md`.
//!
//! NAMED ITERATION DIMS (NOT generic c0/c1): the SuperDSC iteration space uses
//! fixed slots `in_/out_/mb_/i_/j_/ki_/kj_/x_/x1_/y_/r_/c_/ij_/…` (-1 = unused).
//! For a matmul A[mb,in] · W[in,out] → O[mb,out]: `in_`=K (reduction), `out_`=N,
//! `mb_`=M, `x_`=tiling factor. Pointwise add over [mb,out] uses `i_`/`j_`/`ij_`.
//!
//! HARDWARE: 32 cores, 2 corelets/core; STICK = 128 B = 64 fp16 elems; per-core
//! span limit 256 MiB. fp16 everywhere → dataFormat_ "SEN169_FP16", wordLength 2,
//! stickSize_ 64.

// The SuperDSC struct fields mirror the DeepTools fixture JSON keys VERBATIM
// (trailing-underscore / camelCase, e.g. `coreFoldProp_`, `numWkSlicesPerDim_`),
// so the serde field name IS the JSON key. snake_case renaming would break the
// wire format — silence the lint for the whole module.

// ── EMIT-TIME CONSTANTS THAT USED TO BE ENVIRONMENT READS ───────────────────
//
// ⛔⛔⛔ THE EMITTER MUST NOT READ THE SHELL. `#[forward]` compiles
// `(config.json, math DSL)` into an artifact. An `env::var` in here makes it
// `(config.json, math DSL, whoever's shell ran cargo)` — two builds of identical
// source emit different bundles, and nothing downstream can be called a constant.
//
// ⛔ THE COST IS ON THE RECORD, in `spyre_load.rs`'s own comment: a bundle baked
// WITHOUT a K-split flag and served by a worker that read the flag staged blocks
// the bundle had no room for — every completion came back EMPTY, RC=0, no error,
// and it "cost four runs and one wrong conclusion". The WORKER was then fixed to
// ask the bundle instead of the environment. The EMITTER was not, so the same
// two-processes-agreeing-by-convention hazard survived one level up.
//
// ⭐ EACH VALUE BELOW IS WHAT THE UNSET VARIABLE PRODUCED. None of these is set
// by the canonical pod env or its build wrapper, so the unset case IS the
// production case and this is a pure constant-ification: the bundle fingerprints
// do not move. Changing one is now a source edit that recompiles, which is what
// makes it a constant rather than a configuration.
//
// ✅ `SCRATCHY_SUPERDSC_GROUP_SIZE` IS NOW HERE TOO — see [`GroupSize`]. It was held
// back "until someone settles it on a card" because two authorities looked like they
// disagreed on throughput; they did not. The "it tanks throughput" warning is about
// 2048, while 128-vs-512 is the same speed in three independent measurements. What
// the card DID settle is worse than a throughput question: the two values give
// DIFFERENT OUTPUT at width 8, so the partition can never be ambient.

// ⭐⭐⭐ THE WIRE LAYER LIVES IN `ktir_superdsc::wire` — `Dsc`, `SdscOp` and the whole
// `#[derive(Serialize)]` family, the three fp8 nested-fold generators, and the HBM segment
// constants. The extraction plan claimed these could only move WITH `emit_sdsc`; they could not,
// because every one is pure data with `pub` fields and the generators take extents plus a
// `StickLayout`. So the crate owns the SuperDSC TYPE while `emit_sdsc` is still on this side
// constructing it. Re-exported so every in-file and cross-crate path resolves unchanged.

// name still resolved — it was reachable, just never called. `OpFunc::ex_unit` is the sole producer.

// ⛔⛔⛔ AND IT IS THE SAME 16 GiB THE ALLOCATOR CAPS A REGION AT — for two INDEPENDENT reasons, which
// is why an over-size segment is worse than a failed allocation.
//
//   * flex serves a segment's allocation from ONE region, capped at `MAX_REGION_BYTES` ⇒ it fails.
//   * this ADDRESSING scheme puts segment `s` at `s · SEGMENT_SIZE` and `hbm_seg_off` recovers
//     `(s, intra)` by dividing — which is exact ONLY while `intra < SEGMENT_SIZE`. A placement past
//     that decomposes into the NEXT segment: granite-3.1-8b-fp16's tied embedding starts at
//     16,945,651,712 in seg1, so `SEGMENT_OFFSETS[1] + off` lands beyond `SEGMENT_OFFSETS[2]` and the
//     lm_head weight would have been addressed inside the KV segment. Not a fault — wrong logits.
//
// So the `audit_layout_addresses` ceiling check is an ADDRESSING guard as much as an allocation one,
// and this assert is what keeps the number it uses tied to this scheme.

// The per-op `segment_base(arg_index)` above places each op's args in segments by
// their PER-OP-LOCAL position (arg 0→seg0, arg 1→seg1, …). That is correct for a
// SINGLE op but WRONG for the 697-op fused bundle: every op reuses seg0..6, so
// op-5's weight and op-300's activation both bake to seg1 and ALIAS. The fix is a
// GLOBAL layout the emitter owns: every distinct tensor (by SubtileIR id) gets ONE
// (segment, byte-offset) for the whole bundle, keyed by ROLE not arg position. A
// single fused program then addresses (segment, offset); the executor binds ≤7
// segment regions (one per role) — defeating the 7-tensor-segment HW cap by packing
// many tensors into one region at interior offsets (flex `defines.hpp` segment_id =
// top 3 bits of the operand DMVA; one region = one segment_id).

/// checking at runtime a fact that was constant. This is the same audit, moved to where the
/// constants are, where the failure is a `cargo build` error naming the tensor.
///
/// Each check is a fault mechanism, not a tidiness rule:
///
///  * **Flit alignment.** A device address is written in FLITS (`>> 7`). An offset that is not a
///    multiple of 128 truncates DOWNWARD, so the transfer addresses a different location than its
///    length field describes. IBM's own validator for this is commented out in `qg.h`.
///  * **Inside its segment.** A placement running past `segment_bytes[seg]` addresses memory the
///    segment does not own — I1's inner half, which the device checks only on one path.
///  * **No overlap.** Two placements sharing bytes means one tensor's producer overwrites the
///    other's, which is silent: wrong output, or a fault when the second is a kernel.
///  * **Non-empty.** A zero-length field is read by the device as `1 << 27` flits = 16 GiB, in both
///    `handleHostDMA` and `handleXLATentry`. Zero does not mean nothing.
///  * **Allocatable.** A segment is ONE `FlexAllocator` allocation, served from ONE region, so it

    // ⭐ THE PROVEN LEVER FIRST, AND BANKING ONLY WHERE THE SPILL CANNOT REACH. Two passes can bring
    //    an over-size weight segment under the cap, and they are NOT interchangeable — one of them
    //    keeps a segment number naming exactly one region and the other does not:

    //      prose, TTFT 206.9 ms, ITL 189.2 ms, 5.3 tok/s, 0 WARN/SKIPPED/REFUSED.
    //    * [`bank_weight_segment`] backs ONE segment number with SEVERAL regions. It is the only lever
    //      on the PER-LAYER block (which the spill cannot touch) and its banks are aliasable where the
    //      spill slot is not — but it makes two regions share a segment number, and with it EVERY
    //      forward faulted `CB tag=ResponseTag(7341) state=Succeeded status=Error locator=0x2`,
    //      unchanged across three fixes that MOVED the addresses. An unchanged fault across an address
    //      change says the addresses are not what is wrong: dxp wires producer→consumer BY SEGMENT, so
    //      a shared segment number is suspected to be structurally inexpressible.
    //
    //    So take the spill wherever it has a lever at all — i.e. wherever the PER-LAYER BLOCK ALONE
    //    fits one region, which is the only part the spill cannot move — and fall back to banking only
    //    for a model whose per-layer block is itself over the cap (13B/30B/70B dense fp16), where the
    //    spill is powerless and banking is the only expressible answer. Both are no-ops for the
    //    overwhelming case of a weight segment that fits one region.
    //
    //    ⛔ Do NOT reorder these on the grounds that banking is more general. It is more general and
    //    it does not work yet; the spill is narrower and it is measured. Settle the stitcher question

/// ⭐⭐⭐ THE WEIGHT SEGMENT AS A **BANK** OF DEVICE REGIONS — what lifts the 16 GiB ceiling on a

///
/// A segment is ONE `FlexAllocator` allocation served from ONE region, and a region is
/// [`bundle::MAX_SEGMENT_BYTES`]; the same 16 GiB is the addressing stride (`SEGMENT_OFFSETS`). That
/// bounded the WEIGHTS of any model at 16 GiB — fp16 dense topped out near 8B — and no segment slot
/// is free to take a second one (0 intermediates, 1 weights, 2 KV, 3 activations, 4 logits, 5+6
/// intermediate COLORS, all occupied; taking a colour is what the `WeightOverflow = 5` attempt got
/// wrong).
///
/// ⭐ BUT 16 GiB IS A LIMIT ON BYTES PER REGION, NOT ON ADDRESSES PER SEGMENT. The rolled body bakes
/// only LAYER 0's offsets and reaches layer `v` by advancing the base it is handed
/// (`off[SEG_WEIGHT] = v·weight_stride`), and `tensor_allocs` is positional per launch with no
/// segment identity in a `DevAddr`. So layer `v` can be handed a DIFFERENT REGION in slot 1 with the
/// same descriptors — the weight segment becomes N regions, and the ceiling becomes N × 16 GiB.
///
/// ⛔ THREE RULES, EACH ONE A FAILURE MODE THAT IS SILENT IF IT IS NOT CHECKED HERE:
///
///  1. **A launch has ONE base per segment**, so a bank boundary may only fall on a LAYER boundary —
///     `lpb` whole layers per bank. A launch straddling two banks cannot be expressed at all.
///  2. **Every layer must keep the SAME intra-layer offsets**, because ONE baked body serves all of
///     them. This pass therefore only ever SUBTRACTS a whole number of layer strides from an
///     existing offset; it never repacks a layer, so `weight_stride` and every relative address
///     survive untouched.
///  3. **The non-per-layer weights go in ONE bank together.** The suffix reads the final norm AND
///     the lm_head; if those two landed in different banks the suffix would be inexpressible. That
///     is the defect the seg6 tail spill hid: it moved only as many trailing tensors as it took to
///     fit, which for granite-3.1-8b-fp16 was the embedding alone, leaving the final norm behind.
///
/// A bank is ALIASABLE, which is the second half of the payoff: it holds only weights, placed
/// identically in every bundle, so `alias_seg_from`'s size + placement equality checks pass and every
/// borrowing session SHARES the owner's regions. The spill slot could not be aliased (its co-tenant
/// intermediate colour is m-dependent), so each of granite-3.1-8b-fp16's 27–28 sessions needed its
/// own 419,430,400 B COPY of the tail — 10.5 GiB of device memory and ~7.6 s of the 25.2 s load.

    //
    // ⛔ AND THE ENV CAP DOES NOT SUBSTITUTE FOR IT. `DT_PARALLEL_THREADS` is deeptools' only thread
    // variable (`strings dxp_standalone`: `DT_DEEPRT_VERBOSE`, `DT_PARALLEL_THREADS`,
