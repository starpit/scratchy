//! ⭐ COMPILE EACH GROUP AS IT IS EMITTED, THEN RECLAIM ITS JSON — a bounded builder work queue.
//!
//! ## The shape of the problem
//!
//! `dxp_standalone` takes a DIRECTORY and requires one json per device op — merging a group's 64 ops
//! into one file is `DtException: Expected empty FoldManager when importing from json` — so its input
//! has to be materialised on a filesystem. For gemma-4-12b that is ~470,000 files (54 bundles x ~8,700
//! device ops) if they all exist at once.
//!
//! Two facts bound it without touching the file COUNT, which is dxp's to choose:
//!
//!   * dxp's OUTPUT is 6.6% of its input and 2 files per GROUP rather than per op (measured: a 64-op
//!     group is 1.1 MB of json in 64 files, compiling to 73 KB in `spyreCodeDir/{init_binary.bin,
//!     spyrecode.json}`).
//!   * **Nothing but dxp ever reads the input.** So a group's json only has to exist between being
//!     written and being compiled.
//!
//! This queue exploits both:
//!
//!   * **STAGED on local disk** under [`StageRoot`] (`$SCRATCHY_SUPERDSC_STAGE`, else the temp dir):
//!     20,341 files/s measured, against ~220/s on the build pod's NFS-mounted `$HOME`.
//!   * **BOUNDED**: staged bytes are capped at [`MAX_STAGED_BYTES`] because [`BakeQueue::reserve`]
//!     BLOCKS the emitter when the compilers fall behind, and [`read_compiled`] reclaims a group's
//!     staging dir the moment dxp is done with it. Measured on a granite-3.1-2b bake: 1047 groups
//!     compiled, peak staging 85 MB.
//!   * **MEMOIZED** on a hash of exactly what dxp will read, so a group whose input recurs is not
//!     recompiled — 470 of 1517 on that same bake (31%), since the rung ladder emits the same
//!     projections at many widths and each bundle also has a fused twin.
//!
//! Compiled output is returned IN MEMORY, keyed by [`GroupId`], for the emitter to bake into the
//! binary; nothing is written anywhere durable.
//!
//! It also makes the build FAIL FAST. The dxp wall that cost a full emission to discover
//! (`L3DlOpsScheduler` refusing gemma-4's 32-core matmuls) is hit on the FIRST group of the first
//! bundle, seconds in, because [`BakeQueue::submit`] returns the first error it sees.
//!
//! ## No dxp
//!
//! On a cardless host (a Mac, a plain `cargo check`) [`DxpTool::resolve`] yields `None`, [`global`] is
//! `None`, and the emitter stages nothing and writes no file at all — the bundle's metadata is still
//! baked, and `bundle::have_device_code()` reports the absence of the programs. That is a CAPABILITY
//! probe, not a behaviour flag: there is one code path and it is taken whenever the tool exists.

/// tracking them. When the build then exits on that failure (the normal `finish()` -> `Err` path), Unix
/// does not kill a process's children for it — they are orphaned onto whatever reparents them, which on
/// a pod is often a bare `sleep 1` that never calls `wait()`. Orphan now, zombie forever.
///
/// So the failure has to KILL them, which means the failing worker needs a registry of children it did
/// not spawn. And that registry cannot be a second lock beside the error: "has the build failed?" and
/// "spawn and record a child" would then be separately ordered, and a sweep could slip between a
/// worker's check and its insert, leaving exactly the untracked child this exists to prevent. One lock
/// makes [`Self::register`] and [`Self::fail`] mutually exclusive, so a child is either registered
/// before the sweep (and killed by it) or refused after it (and killed by its own guard) — never
