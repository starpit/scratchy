//! Spyre's per-op ABI as DECLARED DATA — the counterpart to metal's
//! `metal_op_abi`.
//!
//! Adding one throwaway `SubOp` and reading the compiler's own errors
//! measured what a new `SubOp` costs:
//! five compiler-forced sites, three of them in spyre, with NOTHING
//! absorbing any of them. Metal's equivalent number is three, one of
//! which is the ABI table that takes its class's bridge arm. This
//! module is that table for spyre's tile-op bridge.
//!
//! Most ops the bridge translates have one shape: a pointwise/reduce
//! tile over `[mb, out_active, y]`, differing only in how many
//! operands the DDL call takes (every declared input, plus the
//! output). That is data. Three ops are not:
//!
//! * `MatmulTile` — a different `TileOpKind` and its own dims, since
//!   the K-chunk's output extent comes from the A-slice.
//! * `ScalarMul` — DEVICE width rather than logical `cols`, so a
//!   scalar-mul on padded logits addresses the same layout its
//!   producer matmul emitted.
//! * `RmsNormReduce` — a reduction whose output extent is the accum,
//!   not the active row.
//!
//! Those keep their arms. The table does not pretend to describe
//! them, exactly as metal's declines the weight-binding ops.
