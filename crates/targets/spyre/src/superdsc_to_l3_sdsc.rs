//! ⭐⭐ SCRATCHY'S SuperDSC AS THE SCHEDULER'S OWN `SuperDsc` — the half of bridge 1's scheduling leg
//! that speaks scratchy's vocabulary, so that `deeptools::sdsc::run_stages_2a_2b` can be handed REAL
//! DATA instead of a transcribed fixture.
//!
//! ```text
//! SubtileTape ──lower_subtile_tape_to_superdsc──► SdscOp / Dsc   (the json DTOs dxp_standalone reads)
//!             ──THIS MODULE──────────────────────► SuperDsc + computeOp_ + dsc.name_
//!             ──sdsc::run_stages_2a_2b───────────► a GROWN tree, HELD (`sdsc::Scheduling`)
//! ```
//!
//! ⛔⛔ WHY IT LIVES IN THE SPYRE CRATE AND NOT IN `deeptools`. `deeptools` never depends on scratchy —
//! it is the port of the vendor compiler and knows nothing of `EmittedOp`, `OpSpec` or the tape. So
//! the conversion cannot live there: the side that names BOTH vocabularies is this one.
//!
//! # ⛔⛔ THE LAYERING, AND WHAT IS STILL OWED — *"scratchy knows nothing about l3"*
//!
//! Two separate things had to come out of this file, and only ONE of them is done:
//!
//! 1. ✅ **THE COMPOSITION**, which is a target-neutral pass and now lives in
//!    `deeptools::schedule::stages` (`run_stages_2a_2b`) — the root `CLAUDE.md`'s *"one implementation
//!    of every target-neutral pass"*. Nothing here names `DscState`, `run_l3`, `run_ddc`,
//!    `AddressFoldCoords`, `ddc_defaults` or `Dsc2State` any more.
//! 2. ✅ **THE VOCABULARY REACH-IN**. This file used to name NINE `deeptools::schedule` internals
//!    directly — `l3::dsc`, `dsc2`, `ddc::fold`, `ddc::v1`, `ddc::transformation`,
//!    `transformation_util`, `stages`. It now names ONE declared seam, [`deeptools::sdsc`], and
//!    `grep deeptools::schedule crates/targets/` answers ZERO in code. That is what lets the
//!    scheduler's internals be rearranged without touching a target.
//! 3. ⛔ **THE FILE ITSELF IS STILL HERE, AND THAT IS THE OWED MOVE.** The wire→[`SuperDsc`]
//!    conversion belongs inside `deeptools`, and moving it needs the SuperDSC WIRE SCHEMA to move with
//!    it — blocked twice today: the DTOs are `serde`/`serde_json::Value` types and `deeptools` has NO
//!    serde dependency (its `Cargo.toml` lists only `sys-arch-spec`), and `SdscOp::coreIdToWkSlice_` /
//!    `AllocNode::maxDimSizes_` are typed by `scratchy_subtile` (`SliceIndex`, `DeviceWalk`), which
//!    `deeptools` may never depend on. ⭐ THE SEAM IS WHAT MAKES THAT A MOVE RATHER THAN A REWRITE:
//!    relocating this file deletes one `use` line instead of re-pointing nine.
//!
//! ⛔⛔ AND WHY IT IS NOT IN [`crate::lower_superdsc_to_dataflow_ir`]. That file's ratchet
//! (`tests/dfir_never_runtime_refuses.rs`) freezes `panic!`, `todo!` and `Result` at ZERO, because it
//! is the lowering the bake compiles and a stop there pre-empts dbo-opt. This module RUNS the stages
//! and reports where they stop, catching a panic rather than letting one kill the bake; it produces
//! the schedule the lowering is to take but decides nothing about what the bake emits. Keeping the two
//! apart is what lets the ratchet stay at zero.
//!
//! # ⛔⛔ NO FABRICATED VALUE, ANYWHERE
//!
//! `dxp_standalone` accepts scratchy's SuperDSC and runs these same stages over it to a working
//! `init_binary`, so every fact the target type wants already exists in what scratchy writes. Each
//! field below is therefore ONE of three things and says which:
//!
//!   * READ from the DTO;
//!   * an HONEST ABSENCE with the reference citation that makes absence the right answer;
//!   * a [`None`] from the whole conversion, which is this bridge's refusal idiom — never a
//!     plausible constant.
//!
//! ⭐ AND NO STRING LEAKS INTO A CLOSED SET. A dim name is resolved by scanning
//! [`PrimaryDim::ALL`] for a matching [`PrimaryDim::spelling`] and a `dsType_` by scanning the three
//! [`Role`] variants for a matching [`Role::ds_type`] — the same lookup-in-a-sealed-set shape
//! [`crate::lower_superdsc_to_dataflow_ir::op_func_of`] already uses. An unrecognised name is an
//! ABSENT dim or a refusal, never a substituted one.
//!
//! # ⭐⭐ THE CENSUS THIS MADE MEASURABLE — `-Fsuperdsc,model/granite-3.1-2b-instruct,quant/fp8-dynamic-per-channel`
//!
//! 134 bundles, **24,363 programs, every one converted**, stage 2a run over each:
//!
//! ```text
//! nodes  93,110 (seed)  ->  347,939        = +254,829   (3.74x)
//!   allocate  137,494        block   49,354
//!   transfer   93,110        condition  628
//!   loop       67,353        sync/compute  0
//! ```
//!
//! ⭐ EVERY ONE OF THOSE COUNTS IS AN EXACT IDENTITY OVER THE INPUT, which is what says it is a real
//! reading and not a stride or a default: the seed is one root block per program plus one HBM allocate
//! per HBM-pinned tensor (24,363 + 68,747); `allocate` is exactly 2 x 68,747, one LX allocation minted
//! per HBM one; `transfer` is exactly 68,747 + 24,363, one HBM->LX load per tensor plus one LX->HBM
//! store per program; `block` is exactly 2 x 24,363 + 628, the root and `lx_below_schedule` plus one
//! region per condition. `sync` and `compute` are ZERO because `create_synchronization` runs AFTER the
//! stop and the computes are stage 2b's.
//!
//! ⭐⭐ AND ALL 24,363 NOW RUN **THROUGH** THE MEMORY TRACKER, with **zero** panics and **zero**
//! carrier refusals: re-measured after `stages::Trackers` was wired over the ported LX allocator, the
//! census above is UNCHANGED to the node (the stop moved three statements, and nothing is minted
//! between them) and not one `stage2a-stop:` or `stage2a-refusal:` line is printed for any program.
//!
//! ⛔⛔ THE ARENA IS GONE, AND THE STOP MOVED ONE STATEMENT — READ THIS BEFORE TRUSTING ANY OLDER
//! ACCOUNT. The stop used to be a bare `None` at `try_alloc_l3`'s `allocs.get(&alloc)?`: entry 222
//! looked the allocate node it was about to place up in a `v1::AllocArena` that NO UNIT OF STAGE 2A
//! EVER WROTE, because the reference has ONE `dsc2::AllocateNode *` per
//! `labeledDs_.at(lds).memOrg_.at(storage)` and the port had split it into a tree node AND an arena
//! entry, writing only the tree half. Entry 222 now reads that node through
//! `deeptools`' `AllocationReads` seam — the one cell entry 353's mint fills — and writes its
//! placements back through `AllocationSites::place_allocation`, so the arena has no production reader
//! or writer on the placement path at all.
//!
//! ⭐⭐⭐ THE CAPACITY IS ANSWERED AND THE LX PLACEMENTS ARE COMMITTED — READ THIS BEFORE ANY OLDER
//! ACCOUNT OF THE STOP. `L3Placement::buffer_capacity_even_sticks` (`deeptools stages/carriers.rs`)
//! used to REFUSE, on every one of the 24,363 programs, for want of the `&DesignSpaceConfig` the
//! reference calls `getBufferCapacityForNode` ON. It now takes that borrow as an argument — the one
//! `try_alloc_l3` already holds — and walks `deeptools`' `l3::capacity::buffer_capacity`
//! (`dsc/dsc2.cpp:3977` and its ~210-line `getBufferCapacityForNodePerDimCustomLocation`), so entry
//! 222's `alloc_all_mem` — the ONE committing call of the whole stage — runs and writes every LX start
//! address and buffer offset onto `memOrg_.allocateNode_`.
//!
//! ⛔⛔ AND THE STOP MOVED AGAIN, TO A DEFECT OF EXACTLY THE SHAPE ENTRY 222 JUST SHED. On the real
//! emitted matmul this file's own test converts, stage 2a now runs `set_lx_buffer_type` through
//! `alloc_all_mem`, `fill_transfer_zero_padding_info`, `fill_transfer_multicast_info`,
//! `fill_allocation_start_addr_and_offset` and entry 333's `offset_sizes`/`offset_nodes`/`offset_facts`
//! — 4 -> 23 nodes, **zero** carrier refusals — and stops inside entry 333's `fillDataInfo`
//! (`deeptools`' `schedule/l3/dl_ops.rs:17872`) at `inputs.allocs.get(&alloc)?`: the `v1::AllocArena`
//! that `deeptools`' `schedule/stages.rs` hands `run` EMPTY, whose own comment says *"the only reader
//! left is entry 333's constant-allocation conflation, which is unreachable while
//! `Reads::offset_sizes` refuses"*. `offset_sizes` no longer refuses, so that reader IS reached. ⭐ THE
//! ONE-LINE CONSEQUENCE: entry 333 must read the placed allocation off the ONE
//! `memOrg_.allocateNode_` cell (`AllocationReads`/`L3OffsetFacts`), exactly as entry 222 now does;
//! nothing else has to change here.
//!
//! ⛔⛔ AND THAT STOP IS WHY STAGE 2B IS NOT **REACHED** ON THE CORPUS, WHICH IS NOT THE SAME FACT AS
//! STAGE 2B BEING UNCALLED. [`run_stages`] composes 2a then 2b through `stages::run_stages_2a_2b`,
//! which gates 2b on 2a completing — an abandoned stage 2a leaves entry 333's operands UNFILLED and 2b
//! computes offsets FROM them, so running it there would compute addresses from half a fill. So
//! `stage2b:` reports `0 reached` for as long as `completed` is 0.
//!
//! ⛔⛔ NOT VERIFIED, AND HERE IS EXACTLY WHAT A RE-MEASUREMENT IS EXPECTED TO CHANGE. The whole-build
//! census has NOT been re-run since the capacity landed — the acceptance bake needs a card and
//! `dbo-opt`, neither of which this worktree has. The node counts above are now a FLOOR and not the
//! reading: `sync` and `compute` were ZERO *"because `create_synchronization` runs AFTER the stop"*,
//! and it no longer does — the two programs measured directly grew a full sync band
//! (`sync_{send,receive}_{l3lu,lxlu,l3su,lxsu}...`, eight nodes) and a `lx_below_schedule` block, so
//! `sync` should become non-zero and `nodes` should rise well past 347,939. ⭐ THE TWO DIRECT
//! MEASUREMENTS, BOTH IN-REPO: this file's own
//! [`tests::a_real_emitted_matmul_converts_and_stage_2a_grows_its_tree`] on a real emitted matmul wire
//! SDSC (4 -> 23 nodes, zero refusals, stopping at entry 333's arena), and `deeptools`' own
//! `schedule/stages.rs` fixture for `0_rmsq_o728` (4 -> 22 nodes — which is
//! `REFERENCE_STAGE_2A_TREE.len()`, the reference's whole stage-2a tree for that program, node for
//! node). ⚠️ THE FIXTURE STOPS EARLIER THAN THE WIRE DOES AND THE REASON IS THE FIXTURE: its
//! `SuperDsc::new(.., BTreeMap::new(), BTreeMap::new())` states an EMPTY `coreIdToWkSlice_`, which
//! entry 291's `sdsc.core_id_to_wk_slice.get(&core)?` refuses — a map [`superdsc_to_l3_sdsc`] fills
//! from the wire, which is why the wire program gets past it and the fixture does not.
//! ⛔ `stage2a-refusal:` should now be ABSENT from the corpus print where the previous account expected
//! `24363 x L3Placement::buffer_capacity_even_sticks`, and `stage-stop:` should stay absent too — the
//! new stop returns rather than panics.
