//! A baked SuperDSC bundle: the artifact the Spyre emitter produces and the Spyre runtime consumes.
//!
//! ## One type family, two lifetimes
//!
//! Every struct here is generic over `'a` and holds [`Cow`], so ONE type serves both ends:
//!
//! * the **emitter** builds `BundleCode<'static>` with `Cow::Owned` from data it is about to drop,
//! * the **macro** emits it as a `const`-constructed `Cow::Borrowed` value inside
//!   `inventory::submit!`, with the device image as `include_bytes!`,
//! * the **runtime** reads that `&'static BundleCode` directly.
//!
//! ⛔ THE SINGLE TYPE IS THE POINT. A separate emit-side and runtime-side struct means a
//! field-for-field conversion between them, and that conversion is where a field goes missing without
//! anything failing. Here a field exists once, so the only way to have it at one end and not the other
//! is not to declare it.
//!
//! ## Identity is a fingerprint
//!
//! [`bundle`] looks a bundle up by its content fingerprint. A rolled body names its prefix, suffix,
//! fold-fused twin and every ladder rung as fingerprints ([`SiblingFp`]), and each of those is another
//! registered [`BundleCode`] — so resolving a sibling is a lookup, and one this binary does not carry
//! is `None` at the call site that asked for it.
//!
//! ## Why this is its own crate
//!
//! Three crates name these types and none of them may depend on another:
//!
//! * `scratchy-subtile`'s SuperDSC lowering BUILDS them — and subtile is the generic scheduling layer
//!   shared with the cuda/metal targets, so it must not own Spyre artifacts.
//! * the `#[forward]` macro BAKES them, emitting `inventory::submit!` tokens into each arch crate.
//! * `scratchy-target-spyre` READS them at load, and re-exports this crate as its `bundle_code` so the
//!   emitted tokens have one stable path to name.
//!
//! So the family lives below all three, with no features and no backend deps.

/// The DeepTools `processComputeOnHostCommand` port, run at BUILD time — see [`correction`].

/// Re-exported so the `inventory::submit!` the macro emits into each arch crate resolves through the
