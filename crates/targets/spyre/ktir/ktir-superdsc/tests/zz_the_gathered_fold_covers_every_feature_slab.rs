//! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ THE GATHERED FOLD AT hd=128 — **BOTH FEATURE SLABS, MEASURED OFF THE EMITTED DESCRIPTORS**,
//! because the two defects that made granite-3.1-8b wrong from its first generated token were each
//! stated as a COMMENT and each invisible at hd=64.
//!
//! ## What was wrong, and why no test could see it
//! The collapsed (gathered) fold's two legs were written when `PageScratch::of_pass` refused two slabs,
//! so both carried a one-slab assumption in prose:
//!
//! * the VALUE leg declared `n = MatN::of_head_slab(SLAB_FEATS)` — ONE STICK — with **no slab loop**,
//!   under "ONE slab, because the gather's own precondition is `hd <= POOL_STICK`". At hd=64 one stick IS
//!   the whole head dim, so the missing loop was a no-op. At hd=128 the fold wrote only feature slab 0 of
//!   `run_o`: the upper 64 features of every head's attention output got NO prefix contribution at all.
//! * the SCORE leg declared `k = MatK::of_head_dim(hd)` under a `y`-batch, with "the gather's own
//!   precondition is `hd <= POOL_STICK`, so there is exactly one slab and no partial sums to accumulate".
//!   At hd=128 that is a TWO-STICK contraction under a `y`-batch — the shape `ScoreArm::choose` records
//!   as measured-twice incoherent inside dxp ("degenerate output at a FASTER ITL, which is the tell").
//!
//! Both bake clean. Both produce fluent wrong text. And the door above them refused hd=128, so every
//! green test in this suite was taken at the one head dim where neither defect exists — which is
//! precisely the shape of "a green test pins a divergence as correct".
//!
//! ## What this file measures
//! The DESCRIPTORS, not the call site. For each head dim it emits the whole attention body with the
//! gather on and asserts, from the emitted JSON:
//! 1. the gathered score leg contracts **one stick** (`N_["in_"] == POOL_STICK`) at every head dim, and
//!    there are `nslab` of them per (kv head, request);
//! 2. the gathered value leg's output is **one stick wide** (`N_["out_"] == POOL_STICK`) and there are
//!    `nslab` of them per (kv head, request), whose descriptors are DISTINCT — a second slab that
//!    emitted the same bytes would be the missing loop with a name;
//! 3. at hd=64 the op names are byte-for-byte what shipped (no `s` segment), so granite-3.1-2b's
//!    emission does not move.
