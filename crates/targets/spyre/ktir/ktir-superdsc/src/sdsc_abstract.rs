//! left to get wrong is this crate's rendering of it into descriptors and addresses. Rather than run
//! on-card and discover the output is wrong (which I

//! on-card run, no numeric golden chased after the fact: the math is locked at compile time.
//!
//! Faithfulness: the address model (`dev_off`) mirrors [`DeviceTileLayout`] exactly (a 2-D

        // `self.rows` is `dims[0]` — for a matmul operand that is `mb`, the QUERY-ROW count. The old
        // test `self.rows > 1` exempted decode on the stated grounds that "at `rows<=1` the two
        // residencies coincide", and for a rank-2 `[1, cols]` view they genuinely do. A BATCHED operand
        // is rank-3 `[mb, y, in]`, and there `mb == 1` at decode while `y` is the GQA group — so the
        // exemption fired on a view with FOUR row-major rows and told the card to reconstruct a
        // stick-blocked walk over a row-major buffer. That is the producer-writes-Flat /
        // card-reads-RowBlocked scramble this doc names, reached by a test that could not see `y`.
        //
        // MEASURED on granite-3.1-8b (hd=128, nqh=32, nkvh=8, mq=1): the batched score leg emitted
        // `layoutDimOrder_ = ["mb","y","in"]` with `max=[-1,-1,-1]`. Row-major over `[1,4,128]` strides
        // `y` by 128 — which IS `qs`'s head pitch `mq*hd` — while a stick-blocked reconstruction
        // strides it by one 64-lane stick. Off by exactly the slab count, so INERT at `hd == 64` (one
        // slab, `y` really does index successive sticks — the identity `opspec.rs` writes as
        // "y-stride = 64 = hd") and silently wrong at every head dim above it. No fault; fluent garbage.
        //
        // So the row count a row-major walk actually has is the product of every axis LEFT of the
        // stick. `extents` is that vector, one entry per `layoutDimOrder_`, and the stick is its last
        // axis by construction (`Walk2`/`Walk3` have no other shape) — so this reads the quantity the
        // walk is about instead of a field that happens to coincide with it at rank 2.
        //
        // Rank-2 `[mb, cols]` gives `mb` back unchanged, so every non-batched operand — every shipped
        // bundle — is byte-identical.
        // ⭐ PURELY ADDITIVE, AND THAT IS DELIBERATE. `self.rows > 1` stays EXACTLY as it was, so every
        // operand that pins today still pins: at the head-outermost order `["y","mb","·"]` `dims[0]` IS
        // `y`, so the batch-decode rungs are already pinned and are PROVEN that way on hardware —
        // MEASURED `max=[4,8,64]` at hd=64 mq=8. A first attempt at this repair replaced that test and
        // silently un-pinned them, which is a regression in a working path; this clause can only ever
        // pin MORE.
        //
        // What it adds is the case the row test cannot see: the BATCH-INNER order `["mb","y","·"]`,
        // where `dims[0]` is `mb == 1` at decode while `y` carries the GQA group. And only where the
        // two readings actually differ — a row-major walk gives the axis before the stick a stride of
        // the stick EXTENT, a stick-blocked reconstruction gives it one stick WIDTH, and those are the
        // same number whenever the stick axis IS one stick. So a one-stick batched operand (every one
        // of them at head_dim 64) keeps the `-1` it ships with, and only a MULTI-STICK contraction —

/// ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ WHAT A QUERY ROW *IS* — and it is not something a row COUNT can tell you.
///
/// ⛔ THE DEFECT THIS CLOSES, WHICH IS THE ROOT OF THE RAGGED BATCH-DECODE BUG. The emitter carried the
/// query-row count as a bare `mq: u32` whose MEANING lived in a separate `bool` — and, for the matmul
/// splitter, in a **thread-local `Cell<bool>`** (`matmul/dims.rs`), set once per bundle. Its own comment
/// admitted the hazard and then chose ambient state anyway:
///
/// > "a batched decode's `mb=8` is INDISTINGUISHABLE from a prompt chunk's"
/// > "Set once at the top of the lowering ... rather than threaded through four signatures"
///
/// The result, measured by counting: **101 sites in the emitter branch on `mq`, and FOUR consult the
/// flag.** So ~97 decision points emit a batched decode AS A PREFILL CHUNK — not a wrong value, a wrong
/// KIND. The four that do consult it are the four that already failed on the card and were patched one at
/// a time, which is what sixteen rounds of eliminate-and-retry were really fighting.
///
/// ⭐ WHY THAT IS INVISIBLE UNTIL THE BATCH IS RAGGED. A prefill chunk's defining property is that its
/// rows are consecutive positions of ONE sequence, so **they share one history and one valid extent**.
/// Everything written for `mq > 1` may assume it. And that assumption holds for:
///   * a prefill chunk — by definition;
///   * solo decode (`mq == 1`) — trivially;
///   * a UNIFORM decode batch — **by coincidence**, because every row happens to have the same extent;
///   * a RAGGED decode batch — **never**.
///
/// So a uniform batch was never a control for any of those 97 sites, and "equal lengths cannot see the
/// bug" is a mechanical fact here rather than a rule of thumb.
///
/// ⭐ AND `mq == 1` MEANS TWO THINGS, which is why `bs=1` passing proved nothing: it is both "a chunk of
/// width 1" and "one request". At width one the two kinds coincide, so solo decode lands in a branch that
/// happens to be right for a single independent sequence. Under this type they are [`QueryRows<Chunk>`]
/// and [`QueryRows<Requests>`] — same count, different type, and no site may use one as evidence about
/// the other.
///
/// ⛔ WHY TWO TYPES RATHER THAN ONE ENUM. An enum makes the kind *inspectable*; a function may still
/// accept both and be wrong in one arm. Two types make the kind part of the SIGNATURE, so the
/// discrimination happens at the CALL SITE — which is the only place that actually knows the answer.
///
/// ⭐ WHAT STAYS LEGAL. The count. Batching needs a width of four, and [`QueryRows::count`] hands it over
/// for strides, buffer sizes and extents. What becomes unwritable is `if mq > 1` as a way to INFER THE
/// KIND: the count does not carry it, and the kind is reachable only through the type.
/// ⭐ THE KIND IS A **CONST GENERIC**, not a trait object, not a field, and above all not ambient state.
///
/// This crate is driven by a PROC MACRO that knows the model as literals at expansion time
/// (`codegen.rs` reads `head_dim`/`n_heads`/rung widths from the config and interpolates them), so the
/// row kind is a COMPILE-TIME CONSTANT of the bundle being emitted. Writing it as a `bool` — worse, as a
/// `thread_local! { Cell<bool> }` — demoted a constant to a variable, and a runtime variable is exactly
/// what cannot be guarded at build time. That demotion is why 101 sites could branch on the row COUNT and
/// only four ever asked the kind.

// ⛔⛔ THE NUMBERS THAT USED TO BE HERE WERE STALE, AND THEY COST A CORRECT CONCLUSION ITS RETRACTION.
// This block asserted, as MEASURED, that the width-4 mask segment is "~1.6 MB" and therefore that
// `32 passes = 2,097,152 B` OVERFLOWS it — which is exactly the failing decode geometry, so it reads as a
// diagnosis. It is not one. The `[mask-cap]` instrument resolves the placement by TID from THE RUNG'S OWN
// bundle, keyed by `seqs` (the batch width — NOT `sk_bucket_rungs`, which is keyed by `active_cap`; see
// `bundle_code::LadderRung` on the ladders sharing one name), and on granite-3.1-8b fp8 hd=128 it
// reads:
//   seqs=2  pmask =  2,097,152 B  =>  pages*width <= 64  (32 pages per row)
//   seqs=4  pmask =  4,194,304 B  =>  pages*width <= 64  (16 pages per row)
//   seqs=8  pmask =  8,388,608 B  =>  pages*width <= 64  ( 8 pages per row)
//   seqs=16 pmask = 16,777,216 B  =>  pages*width <= 64  ( 4 pages per row)
//   seqs=32 pmask = 33,554,432 B  =>  pages*width <= 64  ( 2 pages per row)
// The failing geometry needs `8 pages x 4 rows = 32` blocks against a ceiling of 64 — **capacity is 2x the
// need at every rung**, so the mask segment is NOT the deep-row defect.
//
// ⭐ A COMMENT CLAIMING A MEASURED NUMBER IS NOT EVIDENCE. Re-run `[mask-cap]` before trusting any figure
// in this block; the placement moves with `MAX_PAGES_PER_ROW`, the rung ladder and the mask shape, and a
// number written here outlives all three.
//
// 🛑 AND THIS CANNOT BE SATISFIED TODAY, WHICH IS THE POINT OF PUTTING IT HERE. Pages now come from a FREE
// LIST (`f5e26a3e`), so ONE REQUEST MAY DRAW THE WHOLE POOL: `pages_per_row` is bounded only by
// `pool_pages`, a runtime number, while the mask segment is baked. The product is therefore UNBOUNDED
// against a FIXED reservation — the geometry can express a batch the bundle cannot serve, by construction,
// and no runtime guard can fix that because by the time it fires the pool has already been sized.
//
// So the build must refuse it until ONE of these is true:
//   (a) `pages_per_row` is bounded by a const (cap a request's context, the old stripe's only real merit),
//   (b) the decode mask segment is sized from `MAX_FOLD_PASSES` at bake, or
//   (c) the fold steps the mask WITHOUT one block per pass (re-use a block per row, mask per page).
// (b) is the honest fix: the emitter already knows the widest rung and the pool's page count at bake.
// ⛔⛔⛔ THE QUADRATIC MASK ASSERTION IS DELETED — IT WAS FALSE, AND MEASUREMENT KILLED IT.
//
// It asserted `pages * width^2 * nqh * 512 <= 1_638_400` for every rung, i.e. `pages*width^2 <= 100`. Read
// from each rung's OWN bundle by TID (`[mask-cap]`, `8e7dfa96`) on granite-3.1-8b fp8:
//     rung seqs=2: pmask = 2,097,152 B  => cap = 16384 slots
//     rung seqs=4: pmask = 4,194,304 B  => cap = 16384 slots
// **pmask SCALES WITH `mq`** — the reservation already accounts for the batch width — so there is no
// quadratic squeeze and no fixed 1.6 MB ceiling. The true mask bound is `pages*width <= cap/PAGE_SLOTS`
// = **64**, and the failing configuration (`width 4 x 8 pages` = 32) is WELL INSIDE it.
//
// So the mask is EXONERATED, the law was mine and wrong, and the guard blocked the failing case only by
// coincidence. `1_638_400` came from an `attn.rs` comment about a DIFFERENT (prefill) bundle — the same
// wrong-bundle reading that made me call the mask hypothesis "refuted" hours earlier, now inverted.
//
// ⛔ NOT REPLACED BY A CORRECTED CONSTANT, because the real `cap` is a PER-RUNG BAKE FACT (16384 here) read
// at load, not a compile-time const — and asserting a relation whose terms are runtime is how the last
// three wrong laws got written. The `[mask-cap]` line reports it; the REAL cause of the width-4 x 8-page
// failure is still unknown and must be found before anything is asserted about it.

// ⛔ A CHUNK MUST FIT A PAGE AT ALL, or `chunk_write_start` has no boundary to fall back to: skipping to
// the next page would leave the same overrun there. So raising the prefill width past a page has to be a
// `cargo build` error rather than a silent re-run of the corruption it replaced.
//
// 🛑 **AT MODULE LEVEL, AND THE PLACEMENT IS THE ENTIRE GUARD.** This lived inside `impl PagedKvPool` as a
// NAMED associated const (`const CHUNK_FITS_ONE_PAGE`), because `const _` is illegal in an impl — and a
// named associated const that NOTHING FORCES is never const-evaluated. It was INERT, confirmed by
// experiment: inverted to `PREFILL_CHUNK_SLOTS > PAGE_SLOTS` — plainly false — it still compiled clean,
// `cargo check` reporting only "associated item `CHUNK_FITS_ONE_PAGE` is never used". A guard whose failure
// mode is a dead-code WARNING is not a guard, and it read as one in the notes for days. At module level the

/// per-request pitch, and the paged pool has none by law (`PagedKvPool::addr` — "there is no request

/// `r`'s keys — real, well-formed, wrong. A destination THIS compiler places has the pitch dxp derives
/// (`in * out` of the kernel), so the stride is not declared, not overridden and not bakeable wrongly:
/// it is the buffer's own row.
///
/// ## The shape, and why `windows` is in it
/// ⛔ ONE FOLD PASS IS `nb` WINDOWS, NOT ONE. `assemble_attn`'s prefix loop is
/// `for w in SlotWindow::sweep(SlotCount::new(active_cap))` and `SlotWindow::count_in(swept)` is
/// `swept/64`, so a pass emits `nb = active_cap / 64` blocks, each reading a DIFFERENT 64-slot stick
/// block of the SAME page. A paged bundle's `active_cap` is a `ActiveCap::decode_ladder` rung below or
/// at `PAGE_SLOTS = 256`, so `nb ∈ {1, 2, 4}` — and it is 4 at the ceiling rung, which is the multi-page
/// regime the collapse is worth anything in. Sizing the scratch or the index by `nkvh * mq` (dropping
/// `nb`) is the defect already recorded once in `lower_subtile_tape_to_superdsc.rs`: entries read PAST
/// the placement, and past it is the next tensor's bytes read as block numbers — a clean bake, no fault,
/// another page's keys, with nothing left to rebase them because a gathered fold drops the KV shift.
///
/// ## Why `hd <= POOL_STICK` is a precondition and not a bound to widen
/// The copy is a FLAT block move, which requires a 64-slot window of the plane to be CONTIGUOUS. It is,
/// for Kᵗ at every head dim (`[hd, cap]` stick-major on `cap`: window `b` is `[b*hd*64, +hd*64)`), and
/// for V (`[cap, hd]` stick-major on `hd`) only while `hd` is one stick — above that a window is
/// `nslab` runs `PLANE_SLOTS*64` apart and a flat copy would relayout it. So a wider head dim gets no
/// gather and emits exactly what it emits today (`None` here), rather than a copy that bakes and
/// scrambles the V leg.
///
/// ⛔⛔⛔ **AND "WIDENING IT MEANS A SECOND `skip_addr`" WAS PROSE, AND IT IS WRONG.** That sentence
/// stood here as the whole account of the cost and it misnames every part of it.
/// `zz_the_two_planes_block_numbering_diverges_above_one_stick.rs` derives the real cost from
/// [`PagedKvPool::addr`] itself, and `GatherIndexConversion.cpp::computeGatherMetadata` (the pod's
/// deeptools, read not grepped) settles the dxp half:
///
/// * **Kᵗ needs nothing at all.** A Kᵗ window is ONE contiguous [`PagedKvPool::stick_block_elems`] run
///   at every head dim, at an offset that is an exact multiple of one. The refusal was never about Kᵗ.
/// * **V's WINDOW stride is `POOL_STICK * POOL_STICK`, not `hd * POOL_STICK`.** V's slot stride is ONE
///   STICK whatever `hd` is, so a 64-slot window advances 4096 elements — at hd=128 that is HALF a
///   stick block, and `addr = idx * skip_addr + base` has no fractional `idx`, so a stick-block entry
///   cannot name V's odd windows. The unit that serves BOTH planes is `POOL_STICK * POOL_STICK`, which
///   IS the stick block at hd=64 — so the one proven geometry pays nothing to adopt it.
/// * **A second `skip_addr` is FREE, and it is not the obstacle.** dxp derives one `skip_addr` per
///   (index lds, value alloc) pair as `page × the per-core extents of the unpinned dims`, and each
///   gather copy is its own SDSC with its own pair and its own synthesised `idx2addr` writing a
///   SEPARATE address buffer (`createIdx2AddrSdsc`: an `index_input_lds` and an `address_output_lds`).
///   So the Kᵗ copy may pin `hd` sub-rows and the V copy `POOL_STICK` with no interaction. (dxp does
///   `DT_CHECK(skip_addr_sticks % 2 == 0)` on SEN1P5+, so the pin must be EVEN — 64 and 128 both are.)
/// * **THE OBSTACLE IS THAT ONE INDEX TABLE CANNOT SERVE BOTH COPIES.** In the 4096 unit, Kᵗ numbers a
///   (window, slab) `b * nslab + s` inside its kv head while V numbers it `s * blocks_per_page + b`:
///   the SAME SET of blocks in a DIFFERENT ORDER, equal for every coordinate **iff `nslab == 1`**. That
///   coincidence is why one table serves both copies today. Above one stick the legs need two tables —
///   and a second SECTION of one table needs a base that is not the live window COUNT, which is
///   [`GatherRows`]' whole subject: the emitter's count is its body's ladder rung and the host's is the
///   CEILING rung. `windows_max * per_window * nslab` is the count-free spelling
///   (`PAGE_SLOTS / SlotWindow::SLOTS` is pool geometry), and it is `0` for Kᵗ and for V at one slab,
///   which is what keeps hd=64's emission byte-identical.
/// * **And both gathered legs must then slab-split.** The gathered score arm contracts the WHOLE head
///   dim in one op under a `y`-batch, and a multi-stick contraction under a `y`-batch is the shape
///   `ScoreArm::SlabSplitBatched` exists because dxp is measured-twice incoherent with; the gathered
///   value arm already declares one stick of `out` but reaches only slab 0. Neither is addressing work,
///   and neither is optional at hd=128.
///
/// ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ THE SCRATCH'S ROW LAW — WHICH ROW A `(kv head, slot window, request)` OWNS — AND IT DOES
/// **NOT** KNOW HOW MANY WINDOWS THERE ARE. That absence is the whole type.
///
/// ⛔⛔⛔ THE DEFECT THIS CLOSES, AND IT IS THE ONE THAT MADE EVERY ROW WRONG AT EVERY RUNG.
/// [`GatherScratch`] is built TWICE from two different window counts, and the two are different
/// numbers by construction:
///
/// * the EMITTER builds it from the body it is lowering — `SlotWindow::count_in(active_cap)`, where
///   `active_cap` is that body's own sk_bucket ladder rung (`ActiveCap::decode_ladder` bakes
///   `{64, 128, …}` interior rungs plus the `PAGE_SLOTS` ceiling, so `nb ∈ {1, 2, 4}`);
/// * the HOST builds it from `DecodeRung::swept`, which `codegen` fills with the **CEILING** body's
///   `cap` ("`cap` IS this body's swept extent: `bfp` is the CEILING rung") — one number per BATCH
///   WIDTH, with no way to name which interior rung a step will run.
///
/// And which body a step runs is `Executor::select_body_paged`'s answer, taken from the live context
/// length AFTER the host has already staged the table. So for every context below the ceiling the two
/// window counts DIFFER — at a short prompt, 1 against 4.
///
/// With the window as a MINOR coordinate (`(kvh * windows + window) * mq + request`) that difference
/// moved every row but kv head 0's: the host wrote kv head 1's entry at row `4 * mq` while the body
/// read it at row `1 * mq`, so heads above the first gathered another head's — or an UNWRITTEN — page
/// block, with a valid mask over it. Clean bake, `rc=0`, no fence, and a plausible first token followed
/// by collapse, because the new-token block is ungathered and only the prefix fold is wrong.
///
/// ⭐ WINDOW-**MAJOR** IS WHAT MAKES THE DISAGREEMENT INERT: `window * (nkvh * mq) + kvh * mq + request`
/// contains no window COUNT at all, so a scratch sized for 4 windows and a body reading 1 agree on the
/// row of every coordinate they both have — the wider table is a strict SUPERSET at identical indices.
/// The count survives only as an EXTENT ([`GatherScratch::windows`]), which is what it always was.
///
/// ⛔ AND REQUEST-MINOR IS STILL FORCED, for the reason it always was: the score/value legs step `y`
/// by ONE scratch row per request, so adjacent requests of one `(kv head, window)` must be adjacent
/// rows. That is the relation [`Self::per_window`] and this law hold together.
/// ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ ONE WHOLE PAGE PLANE — the gather granularity IBM's own reference uses, and the reason three
/// of this module's "hardware constraints" are not constraints at all.
///
/// `spyre-inference`'s `page_attn_head_major_decode_kernel` gathers `k_pages[kv_rows]` — an ENTIRE PAGE
/// by ONE index value — inside a per-page online-softmax loop, and its probe
/// (`tests/probes/test_spyre_fallback_probes.py`) runs that at `head_size=128`. We gathered a 64-slot
/// WINDOW OF ONE PLANE instead, which is contiguous only while `hd == POOL_STICK`. That single choice is
/// the sole origin of ALL THREE of:
///   * [`GatherScratch::of_fold_pass`] refusing `hd > POOL_STICK`,
///   * "the two planes number blocks differently above one stick" (Kᵗ vs Knat/V),
///   * and the 32-entry IBR overflow — `nkvh * windows * mq` is 64/128/256 at width 8 against dxp's ONE
///     32-word stick, while ONE ENTRY PER REQUEST cannot overflow it at any width the ladder admits.
///
/// ## The contiguity, proven from [`PagedKvPool::addr`] and not assumed
/// For `Knat`/`V`, `addr = kvh * plane_block_elems + (feat/stk)*(pls*stk) + slot*stk + feat%stk`, with
/// `plane_block_elems == hd * PAGE_SLOTS` and `pls == plane_extent()`. Because
/// [`PagedKvPool::WRITE_SLACK`] is `0`, `pls == PAGE_SLOTS`, so the feature-stick stride `pls*stk` is
/// exactly `PAGE_SLOTS*stk` and the per-head block is exactly `hd*PAGE_SLOTS` — the slabs tile the block
/// with NO HOLE, and consecutive kv heads abut. So one page's whole plane over every kv head is the
/// contiguous range `[0, nkvh*hd*PAGE_SLOTS)`:
///   * hd=64  → one slab, `slot*64 + feat`, `[0, 16384)` per head;
///   * hd=128 → two slabs, `slab*16384 + slot*64 + feat%64`, `[0, 32768)` per head.
///
/// ⇒ ONE index entry reaches a request's whole page at ANY head dim that is a multiple of a stick.
///
/// ⛔⛔⛔ AND THAT IS TRUE **ONLY WHILE `WRITE_SLACK == 0`**, which is why this is a type with a build
/// guard and not a comment. A nonzero write slack makes `pls > PAGE_SLOTS`, which opens a
/// `(pls - PAGE_SLOTS) * stk`-element hole between feature slabs — every slab above the first would then
/// be gathered from the wrong offset, at `hd > 64` only, with a clean bake and fluent wrong output. The

// ⛔⛔⛔ WHAT WAS HERE, AND WHY IT IS GONE: `PlanesPerPage` / `planes_per_page` / `PageEntry`, a SECOND
// entry unit in which one index entry named a whole page PLANE. It existed for exactly one reason — the
// page-granular gather pinned a whole plane on the gather dim — and that pin is REFUSED ON CARD
// (`PagePlaneExtent::entry_elems` carries the refusal and why). With the pin back at one stick block, the
// factor is `EntriesPerPage` and the entry is `GatherEntry`, which already carry this exact identity and
// the three-term composition's guard rails.
//
// ⭐ AND THE PAGE GRANULARITY DID NOT GO WITH THEM. It never lived in the entry unit: it is the ROW LAW
// (`PageScratch::row_of` — a row is a REQUEST, holding a whole page plane), which is unchanged. What one
// entry names and what one row holds are different questions, and conflating them is what cost the pin.

/// ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ THE PAGE-GRANULAR GATHER DESTINATION — one row per REQUEST, each row one whole page plane.
///

///
/// | | old, window-granular | this, page-granular |
/// |---|---|---|
/// | a row is | one 64-slot pool block | one request's WHOLE page plane |
/// | rows | `nkvh * windows * mq` | `mq` |
/// | index entries per pass | 64/128/256 at width 8 | `mq` (≤ 32 for every rung) |
/// | contiguous at hd=128 | ✗ (`nslab` strided runs) | ✓ (proven bijection) |
/// | planes needing separate tables | 2 (Kᵗ numbers blocks differently) | 1 (all three planes tile alike) |
///
/// ⛔ THE WINDOW AXIS IS GONE ON PURPOSE. It existed because the fold's tile was one 64-slot window; the
/// tile is now ONE PAGE, which is what IBM's own kernel uses (`mask_tiles[i]` per page, `matmul(probs,
/// v_page)` over the whole page) and what [`PrefixMaskShape`] has always been shaped for (`COLS` IS
/// `PAGE_SLOTS`). A window term here is what forced the `nkvh * windows * mq` entry count.
///
/// ⛔ AND THE ENTRY CARRIES ONLY THE PAGE. `addr = idx * skip_addr + base` with `skip_addr` one plane, so

// the walk `matmul_opspec_batched_off` derived. It guarded the `[y,in,out]` KERNEL form, and that form
// is REFUTED ON CARD: it gives every core its own weight start, so `numCoresUsed_` collapsed onto the
// request count and the launch faulted at `job_bin_ptr + cores*128` at rungs 2, 4 and 8 alike (the
// syndrome, locator and case set bit-identical; only the index moved).
//
// The collapsed fold now reaches request `r`'s block by a baked OFFSET
// (`GatherScratch::kernel_row_off`) with `y` back on the GQA group, so no operand strides across
// requests and there is no derived request stride left to check. The relation that replaces it — the
// declared kernel is EXACTLY one scratch row, or op `r` reads request `r+1`'s keys — lives on that
// door, where both numbers are the scratch's own.

/// THE POOL A BATCH SHARES — every row owns the WHOLE page list, and the row separates them inside
/// each page.
///
/// A SuperDSC launch resolves exactly ONE page base, so one launch can address B rows only if row
/// `r`'s base is `base + r * stride` for a single stride, AND that stride is a number the emitter
/// baked. Whether both hold is not a detail: it is the entire cost of batched decode. Measured on
/// granite-3.1-2b at eight requests, a launch costs ~88 us of device time whatever it contains — a
/// one-trip group and a sixteen-trip group both read ~0.09 ms, while the group holding every matmul in
/// the layer does 79 trips in 0.268 ms. So the step is priced in launches, and a bs=8 layer spends
/// 27.6 of them: one for the matmuls, one for attn_o, one for fq_absx, and then 8 + 8 + 8.58 because
/// the cache write, the Kᵀ re-transpose and the prefix fold each run once PER REQUEST. That is 95 ms
/// of a 119 ms step.
///
/// They run per request because the map they consult is a free list. `alloc_pages` hands out the
/// lowest free page as each request grows, so row `r`'s pages are an arbitrary set and the base is
/// not affine in `r` — Kani finds the counterexample in under half a second (rows at physical pages
/// 0, 1, 3 have no single stride). Nothing about the addressing is wrong; it simply cannot be
/// expressed as one launch.
///
/// ⛔ **AND CUTTING THE POOL INTO ONE RUN PER ROW DOES NOT FIX IT.** That was this type's first shape:
/// row `r` owned pages `[r * pages_per_row, (r+1) * pages_per_row)`, which IS affine in the row. But
/// its stride is `pages_per_row * page_stride` and `pages_per_row = pool_pages / rows` comes from
/// `SUPERDSC_POOL_PAGES` or from whatever pool the loaded bundle found — a runtime number. A matmul
/// steps its batch axis by `in * out` of a kernel declared when the bundle was COMPILED, so a stride
/// only knowable at launch cannot be stepped at all, however affine it is. Kani
/// `request_separation_does_not_depend_on_the_pool_size` exhibits two pools of identical geometry
/// whose rows sit different distances apart.
///
/// So the request moved INTO the page instead, where its stride was `hd * PAGE_SLOTS` — geometry, and
/// the kernel's own declared block size. THAT SHAPE IS THE ONE THAT WAS UNDONE: a page holds SLOTS
/// again and a row owns its own consecutive PAGES, so `physical(lp) = row * pages_per_row + lp` and the
/// stride between rows is a PAGE stride. The launch can step it because the fold installs the page maps.
///
/// ⛔ **AND THE CAPACITY PRICE IS BACK.** This paragraph used to read "there is no capacity price — a
/// page belongs to all `ROWS` requests at once, so `8` pages is `2048` positions whether a request is
/// alone or in a batch of 32". Striping made that false and the sentence survived the rebuild, which is
/// exactly the doc a reader would trust while hunting the opposite symptom: a soloist now gets
/// `pool_pages / rows` and NOTHING MORE, because the pages of the 31 rows it is not using are not

// ⛔⛔⛔ `KvRow` WAS HERE, AND ITS DELETION IS THE POINT OF THIS COMMIT: NO REQUEST CONCEPT BELOW THE HOST.
//
// A row was a request's identity in the KV pool, claimed on first forward and held for life. It stopped being
// an ADDRESS term long before it died (`PageRun`'s `physical(lp) = row * pages_per_row + lp` went with the
// stripe, and pages come from the host's block table), after which it survived for exactly one purpose:
// naming the pool pages reserved to back a batched write past a request's own keys. The host allocates that
// page now (`own pages + 1`, `KvSlotSpan::blocks_this_step`), so a request has no identity down here at all —
// its KV is its slot history plus the scheduler's block ids, both of which every backend already has.
//
// ⭐ THE LESSON WORTH KEEPING IS THE DISTINCTION IT ENFORCED: a KV row and a `LaunchSlot` were one `u32` for a
// day and it cost a session. A row was an allocation identity outliving any forward; a slot is a position in
// the launch happening now, and the rung decides how many exist. Conflating them coupled the launch WIDTH to
// the highest row any live request held, so four requests on rows 4..7 selected the four-wide rung and could
// not be expressed in it. `LaunchSlot` remains, and it is now the ONLY "which row" number in this file.

/// A ROW OF THE LAUNCH HAPPENING NOW — `0..width` of the rung being run, and the index every op's

/// ONE ROW'S PAGES, AS A RUN. Built only by [`PoolSplit::run`], so a non-affine page map is not a
/// value this type can hold — which is the point: it is a build-time guard, not a checked invariant.
///
/// The run is now the WHOLE pool, identically for every row, because the row separates requests inside
/// a page rather than by choosing pages. It is still a distinct type per row, and still the only way to
/// get a physical page, so nothing that consults a row's pages can forget which row it asked about —
/// and the pool can go back to being cut into runs (a denser page, a per-row reservation) without
/// touching a caller.
// ⛔⛔⛔ `PageRun` IS DELETED, AND THAT DELETION *IS* THE LOCK-DOWN.
//
// It held `physical(lp) = row * pages_per_row + lp` — a page address DERIVED BY FORMULA from the row. That
// formula is what made two requests sharing a page unrepresentable, which is why spyre became the only
// backend whose worker reported `supports_prefix_caching() == false`, and it is what capped one request at
// `pool_pages / rows` (the cap that killed granite-8b at 768 positions). metal and cuda address KV through
// an arbitrary per-request `block_table` (`gpu_worker.rs`) and neither problem exists there.
//
// Pages now come from a FREE LIST (`pages_held` + `ensure_pages`, `f5e26a3e`), so a request's page list IS
// its block table. Nothing in the tree maps `(row, logical page) -> physical page` any more, so the stripe
// cannot be written down again without re-introducing this type — which is exactly the point. A guard that
// only *documented* the rule would leave the formula one keystroke away; deleting the API makes the whole
// CLASS unrepresentable.
//
// What a `KvRow` still means: the identity of a LAUNCH SLOT (`PoolSplit::row`/`all_rows` still mint it).
// It is no longer a capacity share, and no longer an address term.
/// The address model EXPOSES the live inf bug — `sp` written per-head as `[1,cap]` (a=1,
/// contiguous) but read full as `[nqh,cap]` (a=nqh, device-tiled `[cap/64,nqh,64]`) resolves the
