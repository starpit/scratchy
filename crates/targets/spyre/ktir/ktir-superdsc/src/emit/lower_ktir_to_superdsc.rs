//! KTIR → SuperDSC — **`ibm/main`'s `lower_*_node` bodies, with exactly one thing changed: their
//! input door.**
//!
//! ⛔⛔⛔ NOTHING HERE IS A GENERIC OP WALK, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT. A walk that mapped each
//! `arith.*`/`math.*`/`linalg.*` op to an `OpFunc` lived here and was deleted: KTIR names ops at a
//! grain this device does not have descriptors for, so the walk kept asking the dxp scheduler for
//! shapes it refuses — a `linalg.transpose` of a per-step `[1, 64]` key became a restickify whose
//! stick extent is 1, which is not a whole multiple of the 64-element SEN169_FP16 stick. main's
//! attention never transposes a `[1, 64]` key: its Kᵀ is a whole-page re-transpose. The mapping
//! authority is main's bodies, not a per-op table.
//!
//! ⛔ AND NOTHING HERE SERIALIZES ANYTHING. These bodies build SuperDSC as VALUES through the SAME
//! proven builders the SubtileIR path used — `pw1`/`pw2`/`assemble_matmul`/`assemble_rmsnorm`/
//! `assemble_attn` — and everything after that is main's mechanism, unchanged: `render_dxp_input`
//! renders, `launch_index` partitions, and the `superdsc_bake` queue stages, seals and compiles.
//!
//! ⭐ THE DOOR. Each body took a `&SubtileNode` and read its output tensor, its input regions and its
//! op attributes off it. It now takes the node's KTIR program, where all of that is already carried:
//!
//!   * `KtirNode::args[i]` is the SubtileIR tensor the `i`-th parameter points at — that field's own
//!     doc says "the pairing is CARRIED, not re-derived" — and `crate::place::act_name(tid)` is the
//!     operand-name spelling every proven builder and `BundleLayout` agree on, i.e. exactly what
//!     `ds_name` gave the SubtileIR path;
//!   * a parameter's `ktdp.construct_memory_view` states the buffer's `[rows, cols]` and its
//!     `ktdp.construct_access_tile` states the window taken of it — together, the `TensorRegion`;
//!   * a model constant (a ScalarMul scale, an rmsnorm eps, the attention multiplier) arrives as a
//!     parameter at its RESERVED tid, so its registry index is recovered by inverting
//!     `scalarmul_scale_tid` rather than by a value lookup;
//!   * the node KIND is the program's own name, written by the producer (`matmul_s2`, `rmsnorm_s1`,
//!     `attn_s7`, …). Reading that name is not recognition.
//!
//! ⭐ [`super::ktir_matmul_fp8`] IS THIS PATTERN ALREADY DONE — main's `lower_matmul_node` arity-3
//! branch, unchanged, reached from facts the KTIR states — and the fp8 arm below calls it.

///
/// ⭐ (d) IS THE BUG THIS FUNCTION ALREADY HAD ONCE, in two ways at once: the operand that did not

/// ⚠️ WHAT (b) ACTUALLY DISCRIMINATES, MEASURED BY MUTATION RATHER THAN ASSUMED — the same finding

/// EQUALS `cols`, so both branches return the same answer, and deleting the narrowing condition

/// `f32_splat` emits `arith.constant` (scalar) then `tensor.splat`, so the value is one hop behind the

/// which this crate already emits on card as a first-class pointwise (`Elementwise::Rsqrt =>

/// feeds the root — so the reading takes both roots and stays exactly as structural: one root op in
/// the whole program, exactly one splat among the two operands of the add that feeds it.
///
/// ⭐⭐⭐ AND THE DESCRIPTOR THIS PROGRAM LOWERS TO ALREADY SPELLS IT `rsqrt`. Step 4 of
/// [`assemble_rmsnorm`] is
/// `pw1("rmrsqrt_…", "rsqrt", …)`, and its own comment says "ONE native `rsqrt` (torch.rsqrt), NOT
/// sqrt+reciprocal". So a program that states `math.rsqrt` matches what this crate EMITS more
/// closely than `KtirFunc`'s `math.sqrt` + `arith.divf` does, and the reader was the only thing in
/// the path narrower than both. (Step 2 lines up the same way: it is one native `mean` reduce that
/// "folds 1/N into the reduce scale", which is exactly a producer that multiplies by a splatted
/// `1/cols` rather than dividing — see the mean's operand below.)
///
/// ⛔ THE ALTERNATIVE WAS TO NORMALISE `math.rsqrt` AWAY IN THE PRODUCER, AND IT IS UNSOUND HERE.
/// [`elementwise`] takes its kind as an ARGUMENT and never reads the program's op, so rewriting every
/// `math.rsqrt` into `math.sqrt` + a reciprocal would leave an `Elementwise(Rsqrt)` node whose program
/// says "sqrt then divide" while its descriptor computes `rsqrt` — the program/descriptor divergence
/// the epsilon door itself exists to prevent. Rewriting only inside an rmsnorm requires recognising an

    // The general per-(row,head) loop below emits 4 ops per (row,head) — at granite prefill that is
    // mq(31)*nqh(32)*4 = 3968 ops for Q plus mq*nkvh*4 = 992 for K, i.e. ~83% of the ENTIRE 5990-op
    // prefill body. Decode dodges this via the mq==1 head-batch short-circuit above; prefill had no
    // equivalent.
    //
    // Heads CANNOT be batched at mq>1: head h row r lives at `h*mq*hd + r*hd`, so consecutive heads
    // are mq*hd apart while an op's own row stride is hd. But for a FIXED head the rows ARE
    // contiguous at stride hd, which is exactly what a [mq, hd] op wants:
    //   * x/rot/xc/rs/out: base `h*mq*hd`, internal dev_off(r,d) = r*hd + d  (cols=hd=stick, so the
    //     op is rank-3 flat and the address is base + r*hd + d) -> matches
    //     rope_prefill_block_offset(r,h,mq,hd) = h*mq*hd + r*hd exactly, for every r.
    //   * cos/sin: the worker stages them [mq,total] stick-scattered, so element (r,i) sits at
    //     (i/64)*(mq*64) + r*64 + (i%64); for head-0's slice (i<hd=64) that is just r*hd + i — a
    //     contiguous [mq,hd] block at offset 0. The table is head-tiled, so head 0's slice serves
    //     every head (same fact the per-row path relies on via rope_prefill_cos_offset).
    // So one [mq,hd] op per head replaces mq of them: 4*mq*heads -> 4*heads ops (Q: 3968 -> 128,
    // K: 992 -> 32). Mathematically identical work, just not unrolled over rows.

        // remembered.
        //
        // ⛔ `Some` IS THE COUPLING, NOT A SWITCH. Passing the NAME is what makes the emitter unable to
        // gather unless a caller has a tensor to name — and the caller that names it is the same one that
        // must place it (`compute_bundle_layout`, under this same `rows_are_requests`) and stage it

/// one here: it reads its two operands out of the program's own regions ([`split_out`]) and calls the
/// assembler. Unlike its neighbours it ports no `lower_*_node` body, because `ibm/main` has none —
/// main's Kᵀ is a whole-page re-transpose inside `lower_attn_node`, never a node of its own. So the
/// descriptor name follows THIS file's own `<func>_o<tid>` convention rather than matching a main
/// spelling; there is no main spelling to match.
///
/// ⭐ WHY A PRODUCER NEEDS IT. A `tt.trans` of a value the program LOADED folds into that load's
/// access-tile order and never becomes an op. A `tt.trans` of a value the program COMPUTED — a RoPE'd
/// K — has no access tile to fold into, so the reorder has to be a descriptor.
///
/// ⛔⛔⛔ AND IT IS THE STICK-ALIGNED CASE ONLY, WHICH IS THE ONE CASE THE HISTORY HERE DECIDES. This
/// file's module header records why the generic op walk was deleted: "a `linalg.transpose` of a
/// per-step `[1, 64]` key became a restickify whose stick extent is 1, which is not a whole multiple of
/// the 64-element SEN169_FP16 stick". That is not a builder limitation to route around — the dxp
/// scheduler refuses a sub-stick tile (`L3DlOpsScheduler:1040`), and the on-card ReStickify that was
/// asked for that shape anyway wrote the SECOND Kᵀ stick wrong, which is what garbled decode past 64
/// tokens (`ir/bridge/tiled_op_sdsc_op/attn.rs`'s "ONE restickify PER SUB-BLOCK" note, and the
/// reverted "LX-tile block" commit behind it).
///
/// So a mis-aligned extent is a LOUD REFUSAL naming the extent, the 64 rule and the alternative the
/// shipped attention actually uses — pad the row count to a stick multiple and loop whole 64×64 tiles
/// — and NOT an attempt at the unaligned shape. The unaligned transpose is a shape law of its own: it
/// needs a PADDED destination (so the trailing partial stick has somewhere legal to land) and a typed
/// tile-extent door to carry the padded-vs-logical extents apart, neither of which exists here. It is
/// out of scope of an entry point, deliberately.
///
/// ⛔ THE REFUSAL IS HERE AND NOT ONLY IN THE ASSEMBLER. [`super::assemble_transpose`] `panic!`s on a
/// bad extent (every `assemble_*` in that file does — they are called from a `#[forward]` expansion,
/// where a panic IS the build error). A producer crossing this door gets an `Error` it can report
/// against its own op instead: the stick law is re-stated below so the refusal can name the padding
/// alternative, and the builder's OTHER refusal — the per-core 8×8 block division — arrives as an
/// `Error` through [`super::try_assemble_transpose`]. The panicking form is never called from here.
///
/// ⚠️ THE CORE DIVISION NARROWS THIS FURTHER THAN THE STICK LAW ALONE, AND THAT IS A DEFECT ELSEWHERE,
/// NOT A LAW OF THE DEVICE. `distribute_cores` splits `mb` alone to all 32 cores, so today only a row
/// extent that is a multiple of `8 · 32 = 256` gives each core whole 8-blocks — the vendor's own golden
/// `sdsc_interslicetranspose.json` splits BOTH axes and its shape (`mb 384`) is therefore REFUSED here.
/// See [`super::transpose_opspec`]'s guard: the fix is a core division measured against that fixture,
/// which is out of scope of an entry point and must not be guessed from one fixture point.

             because it cannot be described. THE REFUSED CELL IS THE CONJUNCTION: `rows > 1` AND a \
             reduced extent past ONE STICK ({stick} elements at fp16). Inside it the on-card \
             reduce-MAX mis-combines the per-stick partial maxima and hands back THE SEED, so this \
             would emit a well-formed descriptor, bake, exit 0 under `dxp_standalone` (which executes \
             no arithmetic), and return that seed for all {rows} rows — a softmax built on it computes \
             `exp(x - 0)`, silently.              DO NOT READ THIS AS EITHER AXIS ALONE; each single-axis reading has a shipping, \
             hardware-proven counter-example. `rows > 1` is NOT the defect: \
             `ir/bridge/tiled_op_sdsc_op/attn.rs`'s `attn_bmax` reduces MAX at `rows = nqh > 1` with \
             `width` one stick at 31 tok/s on card, and that file records a per-row split TRIED AND \
             REVERTED (2026-07-28) against exactly that comparison. A width past one stick is NOT the \
             defect either: `emit/ktir_matmul_fp8.rs`'s `fq_amax_op` reduces MAX over the whole hidden \
             width `k` (2048/4096, many sticks) on every fp8 matmul, and at decode (`m == 1`) that is \
             this same rank-3 flat emission at 41 tok/s. Only BOTH AT ONCE is broken, which is why the \
             one diagnostic that measured it (`mxp=0` over `[nqh,cap]`) could not tell the axes apart.              THE REMEDY: tile the reduction to ONE STICK and combine the partials — which is what \
             `attention_flash.py` and `swiglu_mlp.py` pin `BLOCK_N = 64` for, as a correctness \
             constraint — or reduce with `sum`, which combines correctly multi-row at any width. It is \
             NOT to split rows: that is the reverted experiment, measured on hardware as zero \
             behavioural change, and it costs {rows} descriptors per softmax for nothing.",
