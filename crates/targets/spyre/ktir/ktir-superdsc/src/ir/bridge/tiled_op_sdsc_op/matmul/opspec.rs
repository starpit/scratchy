///   KERNEL [x, in, out]    stick out  in_dev = the scratch row's sub-rows (rank 3 ⇒ row-major)
///   OUTPUT [y, x, mb, out] stick out  x_dev = the output's own pitch

/// `mb` stays 1 (one query row per request), `y` keeps the GQA group and its 2-D-shared-kernel
/// semantics on the REUSE axis, and the head strides stay the ones [`crate::sdsc_abstract::BatchStrides`]
/// already refuses a mismatch on — the derivation is identical, `x_dev` simply carries the pitch that
/// `mb_dev` carried when `mb` sat where `x` now does.
///
/// ## Why `x` and not `y`
/// See [`super::walk::XAxis`]: `bmm.ddl`'s kernel global layout lists the `%nrd` dims (x, x1) and NOT
/// ONE `%wrd` dim (i, j, mb, y), so a kernel coordinate along `y` has no layout to resolve against —
/// which is what the `job_bin_ptr + numCoresUsed_*128` fault at every rung was. `x` is the axis the
/// vendor's own per-batch `batchmatmul` fixtures carry their batch on.
///
/// ## The one refusal
/// Each operand's request step must BE the derived `x` stride (`mb_dev * stick_dev`, i.e. one stick at
/// `mb = 1`). The two steps arrive differenced out of the operands' own placement laws
/// ([`crate::sdsc_abstract::FoldRequests`]), so this compares the law's answer against the walk's and

///    stride when the op sweeps the tensor's whole physical extent. The decode ladder sweeps
///    `active_cap ≤ cap` of a `[nkvh, hd, cap]` Kᵀ cache, and the V cache is `nqh`-sized while
///    only every `gqa`-th head slot is live — in both cases the real `y` stride is LARGER than
///    `in · out`. `kernel_device_extent = Some((dim, phys))` declares that dim's TRUE physical
///    extent via [`TensorArg::with_device_extent`] (torch-spyre's `arg.device_size`), so stride
///    derivation uses `phys` and the sub-rung ladder addresses correctly. Without it a batched
///    score is right only at the top rung — the "no ladder-safe drop-in exists" obstacle.
