//! The DECLARED WALK of a matmul operand — the axis ORDER the descriptor carries
//! (`layoutDimOrder_`), which IS a stride assignment:
//!
//!   * a row-major (`Flat`-classified) tensor is walked with axis `i` striding by the
//!     product of the extents of every axis AFTER it ([`StickLayout::off_view`]'s
//!     `RowMajor` fold, and dxp's own reconstruction of a pinned `maxDimSizes_`);
//!   * a rank-2 stick-on-last tensor is stick-blocked (`RowBlocked`/`Kernel`), where the
//!     row axis strides by the stick width WITHIN each stick group and dxp reconstructs
//!     the walk from `-1` extents.
//!
//! So "which stride does `mb` get" is decided by nothing but the ORDER of two string
//! literals — a quantity with no name and no type, and the recorded mq>1 defect class
//! (attn.rs, "the two are SWAPPED"): `[mb, y, in]` assigns mb the batch BLOCK `y·in`
//! while the physical head-major operand's row pitch is `in`, numerically equal exactly
//! at `mb == 1`. This module gives every matmul walk axis a NAME ([`WalkAxis`]) and every
//! walk a CONSTRUCTOR named for the stride assignment it encodes — and the batch-inner
//! pair (`[mb, y, ·]`, the assignment that swaps at `mb > 1`) has PRIVATE constructors
//! whose only door is the proven regime's [`RungRegime`] impl, so a batch-decode rung
//! cannot be handed the walk that is right only at one row: its own regime's associated
//! order IS `[y, mb, ·]`, and the batch-inner walk is a different type.
//!
//! The stick axis of every matmul walk is its LAST axis — [`Walk2`]/[`Walk3`] have no
//! other constructor shape, so a stick-not-innermost matmul operand is unrepresentable.

/// ⛔⛔⛔ THIS IS THE DISTINCTION THE REFUTED FORM GOT WRONG, AND IT IS READABLE IN THE VENDOR'S OWN
/// TEMPLATE. `ddc/ddl_templates/bmm.ddl` declares its dimensions in two named groups:
/// ```text
/// %wrd:4 = ddl.dimension{} : … // weight reuse dimension -- i, j mb, y
/// %nrd:3 = ddl.dimension{} : … // no reuse dimension -- x, x1
/// %global_layout_kernel = ddl.layout(%ki, %kj, %in, %out, %nrd#0, %nrd#1, %nrd#2) {}
/// ```
/// The kernel's global layout contains the `%nrd` dims and **NOT ONE `%wrd` DIM** — so `mb` and `y`
/// are axes the weight is REUSED across, and a kernel coordinate along either is not expressible in
/// the layout the bake resolves against. `x` is. That is why the per-request 3-D kernel on `y`
/// faulted at `job_bin_ptr + numCoresUsed_*128` on every rung while the vendor's own 16- and
/// 24-batch `batchmatmul` fixtures (`dcg/dcg_fe/scheduler/test/sdsc_bmm_autoBuffer.json`,
/// `senulator/progs/pcfg_dm20_mm_bertb_m2_1c2_fp16/sdsc.json`, both with a restickified per-batch
/// kernel) carry their batch on `x_`.
///
/// ⭐ AND THE COLLAPSED FOLD NEEDS BOTH AXES AT ONCE, which is why this is a new axis and not a
/// re-spelling of `y`: a GQA group SHARES one kv head's page (a reuse axis ⇒ `y`) while the requests
/// inside it each read their OWN page (a no-reuse axis ⇒ `x`). One axis cannot be both, and that —
