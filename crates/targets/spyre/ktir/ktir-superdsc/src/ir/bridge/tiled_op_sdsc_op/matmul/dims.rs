// verbatim.
// ⛔⛔⛔ THE THREAD-LOCAL `ROWS_ARE_REQUESTS` FLAG WAS DELETED HERE, AND IT WAS THE ROOT OF THE RAGGED
// BATCH-DECODE BUG. It held the single most semantically important fact about a bundle — whether a query
// row is a POSITION of one sequence or an independent SEQUENCE — in ambient mutable state, set once per
// bundle. Its own comment named the hazard and then chose the state anyway:
//
//   "a batched decode's `mb=8` is INDISTINGUISHABLE from a prompt chunk's"
//   "Set once at the top of the lowering ... rather than threaded through four signatures"
//
// Threading it through those four signatures is precisely the work that was skipped, and the cost was
// measured by counting: 101 sites in the emitter branch on the row count `mq`, and FOUR consulted this
// flag. The other ~97 emit a batched decode AS A PREFILL CHUNK — a wrong KIND, not a wrong value. That is
// invisible until the batch is RAGGED, because a prefill chunk's defining property is that its rows share
// ONE valid extent, which a uniform decode batch satisfies by coincidence and a ragged one never does.
//
// The kind is now `sdsc_abstract::QueryRows<K>` with `K` in {`Chunk`, `Requests`} — carried in the type,
// so no site can read it without having been given it, and none can infer it from a count. Nothing here
// may reintroduce an ambient copy: if the splitter needs the kind, it takes it as a parameter.
// ⚠️ SCOPED SURVIVOR, AND IT IS A PERFORMANCE GATE — NOT A SEMANTIC AUTHORITY.
//
// The row KIND now lives in a type (`sdsc_abstract::QueryRows<ROWS_ARE_REQUESTS>`) and is threaded
// through the signatures that make SEMANTIC decisions (`lower_rope_node`, `lower_attn_node`). What
// remains here is one PERF/COMPATIBILITY choice: "a decode batch must not split `mb`", whose purpose is
// to leave prefill's hardware-proven bundles byte-identical while stopping a decode batch from reloading
// the stationary weight per split. It is not a correctness fact about what a row means.
//
// ⛔ IT IS STILL AMBIENT, AND THAT IS A DEBT, NOT A DESIGN. `matmul_split_map` is consumed as an
// `impl FnOnce(&[ItDim], u32)` by `TileOp::tile`, and its two call sites in `matmul/opspec.rs` do not
// receive the kind — threading it there touches every matmul signature in the model, which is the
// "four signatures" the original comment declined to thread and is a separate, larger change.
//
// ⏭ THE FIX, and it is a CONST GENERIC one: this crate is a PROC-MACRO compiler. `codegen.rs` reads
// `head_dim`, the head counts and the rung widths from the model config and interpolates them as
// LITERALS, so every one of them — and the row kind with them — is a compile-time constant. The splitter
// should be `matmul_split_map::<const ROWS_ARE_REQUESTS: bool>(dims, cores)` and be passed as
// `matmul_split_map::<RAR>` from a call chain generic over the same const. Then the two split policies
// are two instantiations rather than one runtime branch, and no ambient value can exist to be stale.
