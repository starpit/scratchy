//! Bridge 3 (`TiledOp -> SdscOp`), AttnDecode composite decomposition — ONE algorithm for any
//! query-row count `mq` (mq=1 decode, mq>1 prefill/chunked-prefill), no separate decode/prefill
//! implementation. Ported from torch-spyre's `spyre__sdpa_overrideable` (`decompositions.py:527`):
//!
//! ```python
//! expansion = num_heads // num_kvheads
//! if expansion != 1:
//!     key = key.unsqueeze(2).expand(-1, -1, expansion, -1, -1).flatten(1, 2)
//!     value = value.unsqueeze(2).expand(-1, -1, expansion, -1, -1).flatten(1, 2)
//! scores = torch.matmul(query * scale, (key * scale).transpose(-1, -2))
//! scores = scores + causal_mask
//! block_max = torch.amax(scores, dim=-1); max_running = torch.maximum(M, block_max)
//! exp_scores = torch.exp(scores - max_running.unsqueeze(-1))
//! denominator = denominator * correction + exp_scores.sum(dim=-1)
//! output = output * correction.unsqueeze(-1) + torch.matmul(exp_scores, value)
//! ```
//!
//! GQA is handled EXACTLY as torch-spyre does it: `key`/`value` are expanded to `nqh` copies
//! (one per query head) BEFORE attention, not deduped to `nkvh` — matching the reference literally,
//! and matching the pre-existing, on-hardware-proven cache-write addressing (`qh*cap*hd`, looping
//! all `nqh` heads), so there is exactly ONE cache layout convention, not two.
//!
//! torch-spyre's version tiles this over kv-blocks with an online-softmax running-max recurrence
//! (for arbitrarily long `max_seqlen_kv`). This port does the SAME — blocked, ≤stick(64)-wide per
//! reduce — not the untiled "whole active_cap in one reduce" joint form: that form is mathematically
//! equivalent on paper but re-triggers a documented, real hardware defect where reduce-MAX over more
//! than one stick of columns mis-combines partial per-tile maxima (see
//! `reference_spyre_multirow_reduce_not_broken.md`).
//!
//! BATCHED OVER HEADS (2026-07-27, matching `superdsc-batch-perf`'s hardware-proven flash decode
//! exactly): the per-head score/value MATMULS stay separate (each head needs its own K/V slice —
//! unavoidable), but every reduce/pointwise op in the online-softmax recurrence runs ONCE per block
//! across ALL `nqh` (and `mq`) rows at once (`rows=nqh·mq`, one shared buffer), not once per
//! (head,block) pair. A prior version of this file looped a per-head function once per head, so
//! EVERY reduce/pointwise op — not just the matmuls — was reissued `nqh`× per block: `nqh`× the op
//! count of the proven old code for the identical computation (the real cause of a 31→13.7 tok/s
//! regression), and `rows=mq` (mq=1 for decode) per op instead of the proven-safe `rows=nqh` shape.
//! Each head's per-head matmul writes its `[mq,width]` score/value block into ROWS `h*mq..h*mq+mq`
//! of a shared `[nqh·mq,*]` buffer (row-major); every subsequent op processes the WHOLE buffer in one
//! call — matching the original design note this file started from: "the bmm OUTPUT is nqh-major
//! [nqh,mq,*], so the ew/reduce ops run over rows=nqh·mq".
//!
//! STAGE 1 / STAGE 2 (2026-07-27/28, user-directed): STAGE 1 is decode (mq=1) — sequential-prefill-
//! only, running through this SAME tiled/batched-over-heads path — correct and fast. `pmask` (prefix
//! validity) is head-and-query-row independent, so a single-row mb-broadcast is exact for any `mq`.
//! `cmask` (new-block causal) DOES vary per query row (row r attends new-block col c iff c<=r) but
//! not per head; at mq=1 this degenerates to "repeat one row `nqh` times", identical to the SAME
//! mb-broadcast pmask uses, so decode is exact. At mq>1 (STAGE 2, batched prefill) a plain
//! mb-broadcast would read only query-row 0's causal pattern for every row (structurally runs, no
//! crash, but numerically wrong for rows other than the first). The worker (`run_prefill_batch`,
//! 2026-07-28) tiles `cmask` `[nqh·mq,mq_pad]`, one real per-head repeat, matching this file's own
//! `h*mq+qrow` row order — but staging alone did NOT close the gap: `assemble_attn_block`'s mask-add
//! read cmask via the SAME `mb_at` broadcast as pmask (one row replicated to all `rows`), silently
//! discarding every tiled row but row 0. Fixed (2026-07-28) via a `mask_bcast` param: pmask keeps the
//! broadcast read (correct, head/query-row independent); cmask now reads per-row (`In::sliced`, no
//! broadcast), lining up 1:1 with the worker's pre-tiled rows. Not yet verified on real hardware.

    // position h·mq·hd + r·hd + d (dev_off_stk: (c/64)·(mq·64)+r·64+(c%64), c=h·hd+d, c/64=h since
    // h·hd is stick-aligned). The READ here wraps `qs` as `rb(qs,mq,hd)` (cols=hd=64=lanes ⇒
    // DEGENERATE/flat regardless of declared rows) using a flat base offset `qs_off` — which only
    // equals the true write position when mq==1 (decode: h·hd == h·1·hd trivially). For mq>1
    // (prefill), every head but h=0 read from the wrong location, off by a factor of mq — found by
    // deriving the write/read addresses independently and confirmed by the K/V reads in this SAME
    // function, which already correctly include the width factor for their own per-head offsets
    // (e.g. the new-block K read: gqa_kv_head(h,gqa)·hd·mq_pad). Q's old `h·hd` was the decode-only
    // (mq=1) special case, carried over unchanged into the unified mq>1 path without generalizing.
    // KV-head-BATCHED score: ONE bmm over y=nkvh instead of nqh one-core ops. Every operand
    // offset below is the h=0 case of the per-head form, and each operand's `y` stride is
    // exactly the head-group stride the per-head loop walks by hand:
    //   input  qs  y-stride = mb·in  = gqa·mq·hd    == head h's `h·mq·hd` at h = kvh·gqa ✓
    //   output sc  y-stride = mb·out = gqa·mq·width == head h's `row_off·width` ✓
    //   kernel     y-stride = the DECLARED physical extent (b.kt_dev_ext), not in·out ✓
    // REQUEST-AXIS SCORE: one op per QUERY head, `y` = request, `mb` = 1. The kv-head grouping goes
    // away here — a GQA group shares a kv head's Kᵀ, but the requests inside that head do NOT share a
    // block, and `y` can only carry one of the two. Query-head-major is the one that pays: it trades
    // `nkvh` ops per pass for `nqh`, against `requests`× fewer PASSES, and a trip is ~3.4 µs where a
    // pass is a ~93 µs launch (measured: 8 ops × 8 passes → 32 ops × 1).
    //
    // `device_extent("out", PAGE_SLOTS)` because the op sweeps a 64-slot window of a whole-page
    // kernel; undeclared, `y` steps `in*64` and request 1 reads 64 slots into request 0's keys —
    // pinned by `fold_request_axis_strides.rs`, off the emitted per-core addresses.
    // ⭐ THE STRIDE GUARD BOTH FOLD-COLLAPSE ATTEMPTS NEEDED. A batched matmul lands its `(y, mb)` grid
    // on rows, and whether those are the rows `HeadRequestRow` names is arithmetic nobody was checking:
    // get it wrong and one request's scores are written onto another request's row, which is fluent,
    // wrong and silent. Stated here as a build error instead of discovered on the card.
    //
    // The request-axis form carries the REQUEST on `y` at `mb = 1`, so `y` steps one row and the HEAD is
    // carried by the op's own base offset (one op per head) — which the law accepts unconditionally.
    // The `phys_m` form claims the head on `y` with `mb = 1` swept, and its `y` really steps ONE row
    // where the law needs `mq`; that is why it garbled, and it now cannot be emitted.
    // ⭐⭐ ONE PLAIN 2-D MATMUL PER (REQUEST, QUERY HEAD) — the simplest form that can express this, and
    // the one with NOTHING TO DECLARE. `batch = 1` means there is no `y` axis, so there is no y-stride to
    // get right, no `device_extent` override, and no 3-D per-batch kernel: every address is a base
    // offset, and the pool composes the request term. The four mechanisms that broke the previous two
    // attempts are not guarded here, they are ABSENT.
    //
    // AND IT COSTS NOTHING. Today the fold runs `nkvh` ops in each of `requests` launches; this runs
    // `nqh * requests` ops in ONE. At nb=1, nkvh=8, nqh=32, mq=8 that is 512 op-executions either way —
    // the same work, no longer split across launches, and a launch is ~93 us against a trip's ~3.4.
    // The mask add FUSES directly into the score matmul's own launch in BOTH cases now:
    //  - `mask_bcast=false` (cmask): THE ONE ROW LAW comment above establishes cmask shares `sc`'s
    //    own row addressing 1:1, so `nests.score_rows(h, width)` — the SAME call `sc`'s own per-head
    //    offset already uses — gives the mask's per-head/group slice too, via `DevOff::Add`'s
    //    documented "compose a corner with a within-view step". No broadcast dim needed.
    //  - `mask_bcast=true` (pmask, head/query-row INDEPENDENT): the fused operand's `mb` dim is
    //    marked `Scale::RedNonStick` — the SAME marker `EwOperand::scale()` already gives a
    //    STANDALONE pointwise op's `In::mb_at` operand (verified: a matmul's own output layout is
    //    `["mb","out","y"]`, per `sdsc_bmm_lxopt.json`, the IDENTICAL names/order the standalone
    //    mechanism uses — "mb" means the same axis in both places). Since the value doesn't depend
    //    on which head/group is running, its offset stays `mask_off` UNCHANGED — no per-head shift
    //    (shifting a collapsed dim's address would read past the one row/block that exists).
    //
    //    The BATCHED score-matmul path below also batches `y = gqa` (MatY::of_gqa_group) — pmask is
    //    head-independent WITHIN a gqa group too (every one of that group's query heads shares the
    //    same kv head and therefore the same prefix validity), so the batch axis must ALSO be marked
    //    broadcast there, or the address derivation advances it per-y-step as if it were a real
    //    (Active) batch axis, reading past the mask's actual (unbatched) allocation.
    //
    //    ⚠️ NOT a plain `("y", RedNonStick)` entry in `broadcast_dims`: `matmul_dims` OMITS the `y`
    //    `ItDim` entirely when `batch == 1` (not merely sizes it 1 — see its own comment: "Plain 2-D
    //    matmul (batch==1): dims {mb,out,in} — NO y"), which is exactly what the unbatched per-head
    //    path below has, and what the gqa==1 degenerate case of the "batched" path collapses to.
    //    Naming "y" unconditionally shipped once already and PANICKED on that exact case (correctly
    //    — a silent skip there would have hidden it and produced garbled generation on the card
    //    instead of a local build failure). `attach_fused_epilogue`'s `broadcast_batch` flag (passed

    // ONE STICK PER HEAD, and this is empirical, not theoretical. I removed this gate on the argument
    // that the batched score's `y` stride is `mb*in = mq*hd` — the head stride at any head_dim — once

    // `hd == one stick`; it is the hd=64 assumption, written into the justification of the form.
    //
    // The two legs are NOT alike in this respect:
    //   * VALUE — contracts the kv window (`in = width`, one stick by construction: a resident block
    //     is a stick, the new-token block is sub-blocked into stick-wide pieces) and now emits one
    //     stick of `out` per op. One stick on both axes ⇒ the validated shape verbatim, at any head dim.
    //   * SCORE — contracts the HEAD DIM (`in = hd`), which is `hd/lanes` sticks. At head_dim 128 that
    //     is a TWO-stick contraction under a `y` batch: a shape the validated form does not cover and
    //     that no bundle has ever run.
    //
    // MEASURED on granite-3.1-8b (hd=128): with both legs batched, every emitted address is correct —
    // `qs` at `h*mq*hd`, `sc` at `h*mq*stick`, `expb` at `h*mq*stick`, `ov` at `s*nqh*mq*stick +
    // h*mq*stick`, `vc` at its kv block + `s*cap*stick`, `kct` at `kvh*hd*cap` — and decode is STILL
    // incoherent from the second token. Addresses being right is what leaves the contraction as the
    // remaining difference from the per-head arm, which runs the same `in = 128` at `y = 1` correctly.
    //
    // ⏭ THE FIX IS TO SPLIT THE SCORE LEG'S CONTRACTION BY SLAB (nslab ops of one stick each,
    // accumulating), which restores the validated shape without a head-dim branch. Until that is

    //    `pages*requests` times over. Measured: 137-140 ms of a bs=8 decode step at three pages
    //    against 39.3 ms at one, i.e. 145 tok/s down to 87 — and invisible at --output-len 64, where
    //    the context fits one page and the fold runs once per request.
    //
    //    Per-request, a pass carries `nqh` rows and the runtime rebases it onto its own request's
    //    block (`fold_plan`'s intermediate shift), so the work is `pages*requests*nqh`.
    //
    //    BOTH consumers of the row order move together. Request-major is what makes one request's
    //    rows contiguous; head-major is what makes the whole-batch `mb = gqa*mq` contiguous. The
    //    new-token block is not folded, so nothing rebases it — it is emitted once PER REQUEST and

    //    other no longer writes, which is fluent wrong output, not a crash.
    //

    //
    // GATED ON `hd == stick`: a request is one ROW of the stick-blocked `qs`, which is one stick. At
    // hd > 64 a head spans several sticks and the request step is no longer `hd`, so there is no single

    // ⛔ OFF. Three attempts to give the fold a request axis all produced wrong tokens on the card, and

    // The shape was never the problem — a strided batched attention, batch dimension = the sequence,

    // (`shipped_fold_op_strides.rs`). The bug is in how the KV BASE is composed: the runtime applies a
    // per-launch segment shift (`fold_plan::fold_delta`) AND the op carries a baked per-request stride,
    // and with `reps` collapsed those two have never been read against each other. That is one thing to
    // find, not a reason for a fourth design.

    //
    // ── MEASURED ON THE CARD, 2026-09-17, granite-3.1-2b fp8, so the next attempt argues from numbers ──
    //
    // ⭐ THE COST MODEL. Launches and compute per DECODE STEP, `SCRATCHY_SDSC_SUBMIT_TIME`, this bundle:
    //     bs   launches  barriered  compute   step    per-token
    //      1        122        122   23.4 ms  24.1      24.1 ms
    //      2        362        322   30.5 ms  31.3      15.7
    //      4        602        482   40.3 ms  41.0      10.3
    //      8       1082        802   51.0 ms  52.2       6.5
    //     16       2040       1600   ~54  ms  55.0       3.44
    //   Launches per layer are EXACTLY `3 + 3*requests` in the batch bundle (fits all four rungs), and
    //   `pages` adds another `requests` per layer: 1082 → 1402 → 1722 at one, two and three resident
    //   pages, i.e. `+320 = 8 requests × 40 layers` per page. So the `pages × requests` factor is real
    //   and it is exactly what this gate turns off.
    //
    // ⛔ BUT THE FOLD IS ONE OF **THREE** PER-REQUEST LAUNCH FACTORS, NOT THE FACTOR. Of the 3 launches
    //   per request per layer, one is this fold's extra rep and the other two are the KV CACHE WRITE and
    //   the Kᵗ RE-TRANSPOSE (`lower_ktir_to_superdsc.rs`'s `per_request` loops, which tag `kv_request`
    //   and so break the launch group at `Trip::fusable_with`). Collapsing the fold alone therefore
    //   removes 1/3 of the per-request LAUNCHES; the other two need the same per-request page base and
    //   are not touched by this axis.
    //
    // ⛔ AND A LAUNCH DOES **NOT** COST ~93 µs AT THE WIDTHS THAT MATTER — the sentence at the top of
    //   this note is a bs≤4 number generalised. bs=8 → bs=16 adds 958 launches for +2.8 ms, i.e. ~2.9 µs
    //   of marginal launch cost, because the host submits ahead (submit is 4-5 µs/launch and 5-11% of
    //   compute) and the device pipelines. The honest marginal figures are ~28 µs per fold pass at
    //   bs=8 — and most of that is the pass's WORK, since a pass computes `nqh*mq` rows to keep `nqh`.
    //
    // ⭐ SO WHAT THE COLLAPSE IS WORTH, from the per-page measurement (the fold is ~9.15 ms of a bs=8
    //   step per resident page, launches and redundant rows together): 51.2 → ~43 ms at ONE page
    //   (**1.19x**) and 69.5 → ~45 ms at THREE (**1.53x**), growing with pages and with requests. It is
    //   a LONG-CONTEXT win, not a short-context one — at one page it is 19%, and `scr batch` at
    //   bs=8/48 tokens never leaves one page. Measure the multi-page case or the win is invisible.
    //
    // ✅ AND THE OP-COUNT OBJECTION TO THE COLLAPSE IS DEAD, MEASURED. The collapsed fold emits one op
    //   per (request, kv head) — `nkvh*mq` per pass against the shipped `nkvh` per pass — which is the
    //   SAME op count over the step, since the shipped fold runs `mq` passes. Each op also computes ONE
    //   row where the shipped one computes `mq` and masks `mq-1` away. The per-op price is measured:
    //   forcing `ScoreArm::PerHead` emits 4x the ops (32 of `y=1` instead of 8 of `y=gqa`) at IDENTICAL
    //   launch count (1082), trips and rows, and bs=8 compute went 51.0 → 63.3 ms — +12.3 ms over +8640
    //   op executions = **1.42 µs per op**, against ~28 µs for a fold pass. Op count is ~20x cheaper
    //   than a pass. (Corollary, unrelated but measured here: `ScoreArm::choose` picks correctly at
    //   hd=64 — the batched arm really is faster on the card, 51.0 vs 63.3, so that cost model needs no
    //   revisit.)
    //
    // ⛔⛔⛔ AND THE REQUEST DOES **NOT** GO ON `y`. That form — a per-batch 3-D `[y,in,out]` kernel, one
    //   distinct weight start per core — is REFUTED ON CARD: it faulted at
    //   `job_bin_ptr + numCoresUsed_*128` at rungs 2, 4 and 8 alike (syndrome/locator/case set
    //   bit-identical, only the index moving), one flit past the program's per-core patch table, and rung
    //   4's `{mb:1, y:4}` is the on-hardware-proven solo-decode split, so the `y`-split value is
    //   exonerated and the KERNEL RANK is what the address is made of. What the gather bought is that the
    //   dim is unnecessary: the scratch is contiguous and request-MINOR, so request `r`'s block is a baked
    //   OFFSET (`GatherScratch::kernel_row_off`) exactly as a GQA group's kv head is, and `y` stays on the
    //   group with the bare 2-D kernel that ships. See the collapsed-fold arm in `assemble_attn_block`.
    // ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ THE COLLAPSE, ON — and every half of it comes from ONE `Option`.
    //
    // ⛔ THE COUPLING IS THE POINT, AND IT IS WHY THIS IS ONE EXPRESSION. Four things have to be true
    // together or the fold reads another request's keys with a clean bake: (a) the caller has an index
    // tensor it will STAGE (`kv_block_index` — a name no placement matches is a bind the launcher skips
    // in silence, and a skipped index reads as entry 0, which is a REAL address), (b) the geometry admits
    // a flat block copy (`GatherScratch::of_fold_pass`), (c) the score and value legs both take the
    // request axis, and (d) the runtime drops the per-pass KV shift and blocks the mask per PAGE. (a) and
    // (b) are decided here; (c) rides on this value into every fold block; (d) is the manifest flags set
    // below, derived from this same value.
    //
    // `None` — a caller with no index, or a head dim above one stick — emits EXACTLY the bundle that
    // shipped, byte for byte.
    // ⭐ `zip`, not `and_then` + `map`: both halves are wanted TOGETHER or not at all, and stating it as
    // one combinator is what clippy's `manual_option_zip` asks for (`-D warnings` is the CI gate, and
    // `#[allow]` is not available). `of_fold_pass` is pure arithmetic over the pool's two extents, so
    // evaluating it for a caller with no index costs nothing and decides nothing.
    // ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ PAGE GRANULARITY: THE WINDOW COUNT IS NOT AN ARGUMENT ANY MORE, AND THAT IS THE FIX.
    //
    // `of_fold_pass` took `SlotWindow::count_in(active_cap)` because a scratch ROW was a 64-slot window, so
    // the row count carried `nb` — and the emitter's `nb` (its body's ladder rung) and the host's (the
    // CEILING rung) are DIFFERENT NUMBERS, which is the recorded defect that made every kv head above the
    // first read another head's page block. `PageScratch` holds ONE WHOLE PAGE PER REQUEST, so its extent
    // is `mq` alone: a quantity both sides read off the same rung, with no window in it to disagree about.
    //
    // A head dim above one stick is no longer a refusal either — a whole page plane is contiguous at every

        //      head-major back to token-stream as a MATMUL (`out += out_h · SelT_h`, prefill-only

        //      rank-3 view makes `y` the leading axis, which is what killed RoPE's rotate batching.
        //   2. Permute o_proj's weight ROW-BLOCKS by the `nqh × nslab` perfect shuffle at staging, so
        //      o_proj reads head-major `run_o` directly and the finalize becomes the one-op form above.
        //      Host-side, once, identity at `nslab == 1`. `stage_weight_tiled` is rank-generic and a
        //      rank-4 descriptor already ships, so the affine reindex is expressible.
        //      ⛔⛔ AND IT DOES NOT WORK AS WRITTEN — two reasons, worked out 2026-08-17 so route 2 is not
        //      re-attempted from this note. (a) AT `mq > 1` NO WEIGHT PERMUTATION CAN FIX IT: `run_o`
        //      carries the head on its ROW axis (`h*mq + r`), so the contraction elements for ONE output
        //      row live in `nqh` DIFFERENT ROWS, and a matmul contracts along its activation's COLUMN
        //      axis only. The permutation story is only true at `mq == 1`, where a row IS a head.
        //      (b) AND THE WEIGHT IS STAGED ONCE FOR BOTH BUNDLES — prefill's o_proj reads the
        //      token-stream layout, so permuting the shared rows for decode breaks prefill; a second
        //      permuted copy costs 16.8 MB × 40 layers on granite-8b.
        //
        //   ⛔ A THIRD ROUTE, AND WHY IT IS ALSO CLOSED (checked before writing code): at `mq == 1` each
        //      `dgroup` plane of `run_o` IS contiguous (`dg*(nqh*64) + h*64`), so per-operand pitches —
        //      the machinery that collapsed the cache write — would need the OUTPUT to step `nslab`
        //      sticks per row (`out` block `h*nslab+dg` sits `hd` apart for fixed `dg`). A stick-blocked
        //      walk's `mb` stride IS one stick by construction, and `StickLayout::group_stride`'s fp16
        //      case is pinned to `lanes()` — the only value proven representable on-card (Kani
        //      `fp16_group_stride_always_lanes`). So a 2-stick row step is not a stride this backend can
