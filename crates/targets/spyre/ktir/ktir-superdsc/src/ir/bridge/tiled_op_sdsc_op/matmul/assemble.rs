// ⛔⛔⛔ WHAT WAS HERE, AND WHY IT IS GONE: `assemble_matmul_requests_off_maybe_epilogue` — the
// per-batch-3-D-KERNEL bmm carrying a `RequestAxis`, built for the collapsed fold's two legs. Its form
// is REFUTED ON CARD. A `[y,in,out]` kernel gives every core its own weight start, so with `mb` pinned
// to 1 and a one-stick `out` the `y` split IS `numCoresUsed_`, and the launch faulted at
// `job_bin_ptr + numCoresUsed_*128` — one flit past the program's per-core patch table — at rungs 2, 4
// and 8 alike, syndrome `0xc00` / locator `0x2` / cases `[PrepZeroFlitCnt,PrepSwVer]` bit-identical with
// only the index moving. Rung 4 closed it: `{mb:1, y:4}` is the on-hardware-proven solo-decode split, so
// the split VALUE is exonerated and the kernel RANK is what the address is made of.
//
// The collapsed fold now emits one op per (request, kv head) through
// `assemble_matmul_off_phys_m_with_epilogue` — the SHIPPED shared-2-D-kernel form, `y` on the GQA group —
// and reaches request `r`'s block by a baked offset (`GatherScratch::kernel_row_off`). Nothing in
// attention declares a 3-D kernel any more, which is asserted on the emitted descriptors by
// `zz_the_declared_y_of_every_gathered_op`.
