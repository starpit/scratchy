//! `MetalWorker`: arena + per-bucket MTL4 execution plan.
//!
//! One worker holds:
//!  - a private arena of `metal::Buffer`s, sized by the model's
//!    post-coloring slot count (one buffer per slot id);
//!  - one [`BucketBaking`] per bucket, holding a `Vec<BucketStep>`
//!    (the execution plan) and the pre-built MTL4 `Mtl4Step` list.
//!
//! The execution plan partitions the bucket's command stream into
//! [`BucketStep`]s: contiguous runs of commands sharing a pipeline
//! become a single `BucketStep::Dispatch`; dense GEMM (f16 and bf16)
//! bakes to a `gemm_{f16,bf16}_specialized` Dispatch step (one row:
//! `gemv_{f16,bf16}_specialized`) like every other kernel. MTL4 execution reads the pre-baked `mtl4_steps` from
//! each baking; a bucket is ineligible only if a kernel exceeds the
//! 31-entry argument-table bind cap.
