//! Per-forward runtime buffers that the worker re-binds across forwards.
//!
//! Each [`Binding::Runtime`](super::lowered::Binding::Runtime) on the
//! lowered tape names one of these slots. The worker bakes the
//! buffer's pointer into the dispatch at recording time — so the buffers themselves
//! must outlive every call. The engine writes new content into each
//! buffer's `contents()` on every forward and re-runs
//! the MTL4 compute encoder; no dispatch re-recording happens on the
//! per-forward path.
//!
//! [`RuntimeBindings`] is the Metal analogue of CUDA's `ForwardCtx`:
//! one struct per worker, per-shape buffers sized for the worker's
//! largest bucket. KV cache buffers are split per layer because the
//! lowered tape carries the layer index on `KvCacheK`/`KvCacheV`
//! variants (each layer gets its own `Buffer`); other runtime tensors
//! are global per worker.
