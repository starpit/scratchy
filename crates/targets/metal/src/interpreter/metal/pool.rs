//! `MetalWorkerPool`: growable, capped, semaphore-bounded checkout/checkin.
//!
//! The pool starts at size 1 and grows on demand up to `max_workers`.
//! Each worker holds a private arena, a private [`RuntimeBindings`],
//! and one baked execution plan per bucket — never shared across workers.
//! `checkout()` blocks if every worker is in use *and* the pool is at
//! cap; otherwise it grows by one and hands the new worker out.
//!
//! `max_workers` is supplied by the caller (typically derived as
//! `floor((device_total - weights - misc) / per_worker_arena)` by
//! the model loader / `#[forward]` macro). Keeping the budget
//! computation outside the pool avoids the pool needing to
//! introspect device or weight memory.
//!
//! Synchronization uses `std::sync::{Mutex, Condvar}` — the host
//! side is sync (one forward per checked-out worker), so async
//! primitives buy nothing.
