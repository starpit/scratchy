//! Universal interpreter instruction set.
//!
//! `Instruction` is a closed enum over every kernel-call shape any
//! solver-picked `Implementation` produces. The match in
//! `Instruction::eval` lives ONCE in this module — not per canonical,
//! not per arch. Each arm calls existing kernels in `scratchy-target-cuda`
//! directly. Per-canonical specialization flows through method-level
//! generics:
//!
//! 1. `eval<W: CanonicalParams>` reads model constants via
//!    `W::HEAD_DIM` etc. and weight tensors via the
//!    [`WeightAccessors`] trait — `ctx.wm.<kind>_at(bucket, op_idx,
//!    slot, layer)`. The proc-macro emits a per-arch
//!    `WeightAccessors` impl whose body matches on
//!    `(bucket, op_idx, slot)` to resolve the named field on
//!    `Weights`. The variant itself carries no weight info.
//! 2. [`CanonicalParams`] supertype — trait implemented per
//!    canonical with associated `const`s for model-wide values
//!    (`HEAD_DIM`, `INTERMEDIATE_SIZE`, `ATTN_SCALE`, …).
//!
//! Per canonical the macro emits: a `Weights` struct,
//! `impl CanonicalParams for Weights { … }`,
//! `impl WeightAccessors for Weights { … }`, static
//! `&[Instruction]` slices for backbone + lm_head per bucket, and a
//! 1-line forward shim that delegates to [`run`].

// File is ungated at the module level so the proc-macro can use
// `Instruction` without a backend feature. The `Instruction` enum
// + `CanonicalParams` / `WeightAccessors` traits compile under any
// feature combination — only `GpuTensor` (always available) plus the
// layer struct *type names* (also always available; methods are
// cuda-gated inside `scratchy-target-cuda/src/layers.rs`) are referenced.
//
// `MAX_DIMS` is referenced only inside the cuda eval body (e.g.
// `let mut shape = [0usize; MAX_DIMS];`) now that the `Reshape`
// variant moved with the enum to `scratchy-ir` — gated to cuda.
