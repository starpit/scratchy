//! THE HANDOFF: our Triton-free module -> `ktir_core::ir::IRFunction`.
//!
//! We generate KTIR; their lowering consumes KTIR. This is the one place the two meet,
//! and past it everything is their type entire -- no wrapper, no shadow copy, nothing of
//! ours riding along.
//!
//! # WHY A PER-OP MAP HERE IS NOT THE DUPLICATION WE DELETED
//!
//! An earlier attempt at this was a separate crate translating a whole parallel KTIR type
//! into theirs. That was duplication and it would have rotted: it had to track a type
//! someone else is actively changing, which is exactly how `consumer.rs` came to pin a
//! vocabulary from files that no longer existed and still report green.
//!
//! What remains is different in kind. Our interior IR is GENERIC -- one `Op` with a
//! variant per spelling, `tt.*` and `ktdp.*` coexisting mid-conversion, which is what
//! MLIR itself is and what the C++ passes this is ported from operate on. Theirs is
//! TYPED: 123 variants, no `tt.*` at all, so a Triton op is not "unsupported" but
//! unrepresentable. Crossing from a generic IR to a typed one maps every op, including
//! the ops that do not change. That map is inherent to the boundary, not a second design
//! of the same thing -- and because it is total and fails closed, an op we cannot express
//! is a REFUSAL naming the op, never a silently dropped or guessed one.
//!
//! # WHAT THIS REFUSES, AND WHY EACH REFUSAL IS THE RIGHT ANSWER
//!
//! * **`tt.*` anything.** Their `OpKind` has zero `Tt` variants. If one reaches here,
//!   [`crate::passes::to_ktir`] left it behind, and a module that LOOKS converted and is
//!   not is the failure that pass exists to prevent.
//! * **`ktdf.corelet_plan` / `ktdf.corelet`.** Dropped, not refused: the corelet plan is
//!   discarded before SuperDSC on every path, so carrying it would be noise. Dropping is
//!   recorded here rather than left implicit.
//! * **An op with more than one result.** Their `Operation.result` is `Option<Ssa>`. No
//!   pass in this crate builds a multi-result op, so this is a guard against a future one
//!   rather than a live gap.
//! * **A multi-block region.** Our own parser refuses these already; stated again because
//!   their `regions: &[&[Operation]]` cannot express a second block even in principle.
//! * **An affine form outside the subset we emit.** See [`affine_map`] / [`affine_set`].

/// `KtdpConstructMemoryView` with `AttrKey::Dtype` AND an `IrType::MemRef`, and does the same for

/// as a required attribute -- its one mention is inside an attribute-equality `matches!` -- so the

///     denominated in it.
///   * `ktir-emulator:src/dialects/ktdp.rs:188` -- `construct_access_tile` REFUSES without `Shape`.
///   * ⚠️ `ktir-emulator:src/dialects/arith.rs:554` -- a TENSOR `arith.constant` with no dtype
///     attribute is read as `DType::F16`. THAT is the dangerous one: it does not refuse, it
///     guesses, and for an all-f16 Granite kernel it guesses right for the wrong reason. An f32

///
/// # ⭐ WHY THIS IS A POST-PASS OVER EVERY BUILT OP AND NOT A BLOCK INSIDE THE BUILDER
