//! TTIR -> KTIR. Ported from `ToSchedulerKTIR.cpp` (Task #37 / gap G1). **THE
//! TRANSLATION IS NOT FINISHED UNTIL THIS PASS RUNS.**
//!
//! # WHY THIS IS `to_ktir` AND NOT `to_scheduler_ktir`
//!
//! The C++ file is called `ToSchedulerKTIR.cpp` and this was named after it, which was a
//! mistake worth undoing rather than preserving. The pass does NO scheduling: the
//! "scheduler" in the C++ name is V1's `dataflow-scheduler`, whose dialect registration is
//! what forced the conversion in the first place. Our path does not go through V1 at all
//! -- it is Triton -> ttir -> KTIR -> SuperDSC -> dxp_standalone on the V2 tooling -- so
//! naming the pass after a component we route around described the pass by its historical
//! motivation instead of by its job. Its job is to produce KTIR from ttir.
//!
//! The C++ name is kept in citations below, because that file really is called that.
//!
//! The pipeline is Triton -> ttir -> **Triton-free KTIR** -> backend, and the backend
//! knows nothing about Triton. `make_ktir` stops one pass short of that: its output
//! still contains `tt.*`, and the tools downstream do not register the `tt` dialect at
//! all. The C++ header quotes what that costs:
//!
//! ```text
//!   flash_ktir.mlir:30:3: error: Dialect `tt' not found for custom op 'tt.func'
//!   note: Available dialects: affine, agen, arith, builtin, dataflow, explan,
//!   func, init, ktdf, ktdf_arch, ktdf_lowering, ktdp, linalg, math, memref, scf,
//!   sdscbundle, sentient, symbol, tensor, trace, uniform, varexpr, vector,
//!   vectorchain
//! ```
//!
//! So the KTIR cannot be PARSED by the tools that would consume it, let alone
//! consumed. **Every rewrite here targets an op in a dialect that list names, and
//! that is the design rule** -- not a style preference and not an optimisation.
//!
//! The same boundary is enforced in scratchy's TYPE: `ktir_core::opkind::OpKind` has
//! fourteen `Linalg*` variants and zero `Tt*`. Triton cannot leak downstream even by
//! accident. See [`crate::consumer`].
//!
//! # THE BROADCAST SHAPE IS A V1 CONSTRAINT, AND V1 IS NOT OUR PATH ANY MORE
//!
//! `tt.broadcast` becomes a `linalg.generic` with a **yield-only body**, not the named
//! `linalg.broadcast`, even though `ktir_core`'s enum has a `LinalgBroadcast` variant and
//! the named form is obviously tidier. This used to be recorded here as "not a choice --
//! do not improve it", on the strength of V1's legality check
//! (`KTIRLegalityCheckPass::isLegalGenericBodyOp`), which ACCEPTS the generic and REJECTS
//! the named op as an unsupported compute op. Probe p07.
//!
//! **That reason no longer applies to this pass.** V1's scheduler is routed around, so its
//! legality check is not a gate we pass through. Two facts now point the other way: their
//! type names `LinalgBroadcast`, and their own producer uses it at exactly the place a
//! reduction result has to reach the lanes again.
//!
//! The generic is nonetheless what this pass still emits, for one reason that is about
//! evidence rather than design: the 12-of-12 golden diff is against the C++ toolchain's
//! output, which is V1's, so switching the shape here would break the only check that
//! says this port reproduces the pass it was ported from. **So the shape is HELD, not
//! endorsed.** Changing it is a decision about what the consumer wants, and when it is
//! made the golden gets a recorded exception rather than the diff quietly going red.
//! This is the first place V1 conventions and V2's diverge, and it will not be the last.

/// `ktdp.get_compute_tile_id` -- a PER-CORE UNIFORM, which is the one non-constant form
/// that route accepts.
///
/// WHAT IS GIVEN UP IS A GUARD, AND IT BECOMES A LAUNCH CONTRACT. The loop is

            // every one of them at the top level is to have one copy per trip. So the guard's two
            // answers collapse to one here, and it is this one.

            // ⭐ THE UNROLL IS EXACT, NOT AN APPROXIMATION, AND IT GIVES UP NO GUARD. The loop is
            // `for pid = core_id to work_items step num_cores` with `core_id` in

            // ⭐ WHY THE POSITION IS STILL ADDRESSABLE. The note above records that the grid
            // position must reach the scheduler either as an `scf.for`/`affine.for` induction
            // variable or as a per-core uniform, because compute-group extraction lifts an
            // enclosing loop into the CALLER and the position then arrives as a function
            // argument, which dcc can use in neither place one is needed. After the unroll every
            // trip's position is `ktdp.get_compute_tile_id` plus a constant -- the uniform form,

/// That loop is the flash-attention KV sweep. It is NOT a grid work loop, so `fold_grid_work_loop`
/// never looks at it: it comes from the kernel's own `for start_n in tl.range(lo, hi, BLOCK_N)`.
/// Hoisting its windows is unavailable for the same reason it was there -- K's window offset is an
/// `iter_arg` the body advances by `BLOCK_N` each trip, so no single window above the loop stands
/// for all four. So one copy per trip is again the only answer.
///
/// # WHAT MAKES IT DECIDABLE, AND WHY A LOOP THAT IS NOT IS LEFT ALONE
///
/// The non-causal sweep is `lo, hi = 0, N_CTX` over `tl.range(0, 256, 64)` with every bound a
/// `tl.constexpr`, so the trip count is 4 AT COMPILE TIME and the unroll is exact. The CAUSAL
/// off-band sweep is `lo, hi = 0, start_m * BLOCK_M`: its trip count is the query-block index, a
/// function of grid position, and there is no fixed number of copies that is right for every core.
///
/// **A loop whose bounds are not constants is therefore LEFT STANDING, not refused here.** That is
/// deliberate and it is not a hole: the guard quoted above is what catches it, one crate
/// downstream, by name and with the parameter and the view extent in the message. Refusing here
/// would replace a specific diagnostic with a vaguer one, and -- since this pass runs on every
/// configuration -- would turn any future loop-carrying program into a refusal at a stage that has
/// nothing to say about it.
///
/// # THE SUBSTITUTION IS THE WHOLE OF IT
///
/// Copy `t` is the body with three sets of names rewritten: the induction variable becomes the
/// constant `lb + t * step`; each `iter_arg` becomes the value copy `t - 1` yielded for it (copy 0
/// takes the loop's own init operands); and every value the copy DEFINES is renamed afresh, since
/// four copies sharing one set of names is one trip that the later copies shadow. The `scf.yield`
/// is dropped from each copy -- its operands ARE the next copy's carries -- and uses of the loop's
/// own results are rewired to the LAST copy's carries. Nothing is folded, reassociated or dropped,
/// so the unrolled straight line computes the recurrence the loop did, trip for trip.

///
/// # WHY THIS PASS EXISTS
///
/// The flash recurrence's carries are seeded with `tensor.splat`s -- `m_i` at `-inf`,
/// `l_i` at 1.0, `acc` at 0 -- and after [`unroll_constant_trip_loops`] those seeds are
/// OPERANDS of trip 1's pointwise ops (`max(m_seed, m)`, `exp2(m_seed - m)`, `acc·alpha`).
/// The whole-function door refuses a splat operand by name (`whole_function`'s "neither a
/// load of a parameter nor an intermediate this function produced"), and it is RIGHT to:
/// a splat reaching a compute op would have to become a caller-seeded buffer, and the C++
/// path's `materializeSplatInputs` records the value in an attribute the launcher seeds
/// at runtime -- one more bind a launch can silently skip. The seeds are COMPILE-TIME
/// CONSTANTS, so the better answer is to not lower them at all.
///
/// # THE FOLD SET, AND WHY EACH RULE IS EXACT
///
/// **Identity folds** (`maxnumf`/`-inf`, `addf`/`+0`, `subf`/`-0`, `mulf`/`1`): IEEE
/// identities, exact including signed zeros (`0 + -0 = +0` is the one clause that is not
/// bitwise exact, and it cannot fire here: the seeds are the LEFT operand of their ops
/// and `x - 0` / `1·x` / `max(-inf, x)` are exact for every x). `mulf`/`1` is what trip
/// 1's `l_i · alpha` reduces to (`l_i` seeds at 1.0, the fixture's own divide-by-zero
/// guard).
///
/// **Splat × splat pointwise** (`addf`/`subf`/`mulf`/`divf`/`maxnumf`/`minnumf` over two
/// splat-of-constant operands): folded in f64 and re-rounded through
/// [`FloatBits::to_f16`], which is the SAME round-to-nearest-even the producer used when
/// it built the f16 constant, so the folded bits are what the original chain computed --
/// f16's own arithmetic is emulated exactly by f64 for +, -, · (no double rounding at
/// f16 precision).
///
/// **`math.exp` of a NON-FINITE-or-zero splat**: `exp(-inf) = 0`, `exp(+inf) = +inf`,
/// `exp(0) = 1` are exact for every implementation, including the device's polynomial.
/// A FINITE splat is NEVER folded: the device transcendental is its own approximation
/// and the reference is torch's, so folding would change the number.
///
/// **The alpha seed** -- `subf(-inf-splat, x)` -> `-inf-splat` -- is the one rule that is
/// NOT an identity, and it is guarded to the one chain where it is exact: every use of
/// the difference must be a `mulf` by a POSITIVE splat whose own result feeds only
/// `math.exp`. That is `exp2(m_old - m_new)` with the base change the frontend emits
/// (`exp(y·ln2)`), and there `-inf - m` is `-inf` for every m the fixture can produce:
/// the fixture's mask values are -1.0e4 rather than -inf (its own delta 3, so a fully
/// masked block still leaves `m_ij` FINITE), and a NaN score means every consumer of m
/// is NaN in the original too. Unguarded the rule would be unsound (`-inf - -inf` = NaN),
/// so the guard is the rule's soundness proof and not a pattern-match convenience.
///
/// **Rank plumbing of a splat** (`expand_shape`/`collapse_shape`/`linalg.broadcast` over
/// a splat): a splat is shape-polymorphic -- the value is the whole fact -- so the chain
/// folds to a splat at the chain's final shape. Trip 1's `alpha[:, None]` spray is the
/// instance (the frontend widens `m` to `[64, 64]` for the broadcast multiply).
///
/// # WHAT TRIP 1 BECOMES
///
/// `max(-inf, m) -> m`, `exp2(-inf - m) -> 0`, `1·alpha -> alpha -> 0`, `acc·0 -> 0`,
/// so `addf(matmul(p, v, 0-splat), 0-splat)` -- trip 1's `p·V + 0·acc` collapses to the
/// two-input matmul [`decompose_matmul_accumulators`] already leaves alone, `l = 0 +
/// sum(p)`, and `m = rowmax·scale`. That IS the first-block fast path every FA2 kernel
/// writes by hand (`first`-flag or `SKIP_FIRST`), reached by folding rather than by
/// asking the kernel author to spell it.
///
/// # ORDER
///
/// Runs AFTER [`unroll_constant_trip_loops`] (the seeds only become top-level operands
