//! Ported from `DotToLinalg.cpp`. `tt.dot` -> `linalg.matmul`.
//!
//! `tt.dot`'s `d = a*b + c` maps directly: `linalg.matmul ins(a, b) outs(c)`
//! computes `outs += a*b`, so the accumulator `c` is the DPS init.
//!
//! THE SEPARATION OF CONCERNS THE C++ MAKES, kept exactly, because it is what
//! lets flash attention through at all:
//!
//! * LOWERING (`tt.dot` -> `linalg.matmul`) is a local, always-valid rewrite.
//! * ROUTING (deciding the whole kernel IS a standalone matmul the shape-keyed
//!   single-program builder can emit, and saying so with
//!   `spyre.canonical_verified`) is a whole-kernel contract.
//!
//! The discriminator is the dot COUNT. Exactly one dot -> run the whole-kernel
//! contract and RED-stop any deviation. More than one -> it cannot be the
//! single-program matmul kernel BY DEFINITION, so lower each dot locally and
//! leave it UNTAGGED. Untagged is the fail-closed part: the emitter REQUIRES the
//! tag, so a multi-dot kernel is refused at the stage that actually cannot
//! represent it. Attention has four dots (two legs x two causal stages) and must
//! not be refused here.

        // the kernel declares the buffer -- the kernel's `[n, k]` view is correct and the tile
        // contradicts it.

        // So B is REWIRED past the transpose to the value the transpose reads, and the maps say the

        // PLACE it. The device's kernel slot reads ONE residency and it is `[k, n]` --
        // `ktir-superdsc`'s `matmul` declares `StickLayout::kernel(k_in, n_out)`, whose address law is
        // `dev_off_stk`'s rank-2 stick-blocked form with `dims[0] = k` as the ROW count -- so a
        // transpose-B `[n, k]` operand is bytes in the WRONG order and somebody has to move them:
        //
        //   * a PRESENTED weight (`desc_w.load(..).T`) is moved ONCE by the HOST stage
        //     (`stage_2d(&StickLayout::kernel(k, n), ..)`, `sdsc_abstract.rs:2124`), at bake time,
        //     for free at inference. That is this fold, and it is measured byte-identical.
        //   * a CACHE is moved by the device writing it already transposed
        //     (`kcache_kt_write_offset`), which is why the shipped attention keeps a third physical
        //     Kᵀ plane at all.
        //   * an IN-REGISTER COMPUTED VALUE has NEITHER. Nothing places its bytes, and nothing in
        //     `ktir-superdsc` reads an access tile's `CoordinateOrder` (`grep -rn CoordinateOrder
        //     src/` finds it inside one comment and nowhere else), so the transposing order this
        //     path can set is never honoured. Folding it into the maps therefore DROPPED it:
        //     `decoder_block.py`'s `tl.dot(q1r, k1r.T)` contracted as `q1r @ k1r`, invisible to every
        //     extent guard because `[M, HALF]` is 64x64 there.
        //
        // So the discriminator is whether the transposed value is a DIRECT `tt.descriptor_load` --
        // the only form whose bytes the host stage places. Anything else keeps its `tt.trans`, which
        // `to_ktir::convert_trans` turns into a REAL `linalg.transpose` (a `Program::Transpose`
        // beside the matmul), the matmul then states no maps at all, and MLIR's default `[k, n]` is
