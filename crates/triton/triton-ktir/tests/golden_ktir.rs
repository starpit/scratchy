//! THE ORACLE TEST: the Rust port's KTIR against the C++ toolchain's, per fixture.
//!
//! Input: the fixture's `0_ttir.mlir`, parsed into a VALUE by the test instrument.
//! Output: `make_ktir`'s pipeline run on that value, diffed structurally against the
//! fixture's `1_ktir.mlir`.
//!
//! WHICH FIXTURES HAVE A KTIR GOLDEN AT ALL is measured, not assumed -- see
//! `refusals.rs` for the two that are refused and why a port that ACCEPTS them is
//! wrong.

/// post-transpose shape. We instead spend it in `linalg.matmul`'s `indexing_maps`, leaving the tile

///
/// WHY, AND IT IS NOT A PREFERENCE. `ktir-superdsc`'s `matmul` reads the weight as `[n, k]` and
/// guards on it (`w.c_len != k`, "THE WEIGHT'S VIEW IS [n, k]"), reading the extent off the TILE.
/// The C++'s folded form presents `[k, n]` there and is refused outright. scratchy's own producer

/// `indexing_maps = [[0, 2], [1, 2], [0, 1]]`. scratchy runs Granite at 41 tok/s through that

///
/// ⛔ NARROW ON PURPOSE. Exactly four fields, on the ops a transposed dot weight touches, and
/// nothing else: the tile's order and type, the load's type, and the matmul's `indexing_maps`. Any
