//! THE WHOLE RUST PATH, PYTHON SOURCE TO KTIR, against the C++ chain's own KTIR.
//!
//! Needs the `ruff` feature, because every configuration starts from PYTHON SOURCE. That
//! is the point: no stage in here is handed a file.
#![cfg(feature = "ruff")]
//!
//! ```text
//!   triton_frontend::codegen::compile   .py source -> RAW ttir       value
//!   triton_frontend::opt::make_ttir     inline/fold/cse/dce/hoist    value
//!   triton_ktir::from_ttir::convert     ttir -> KTIR                 value
//!   triton_ktir::make_ktir              the seven KTDP/KTDF passes   value
//! ```
//!
//! No arrow above serializes. The only text in this file is on the GOLDEN side:
//! `third_party/spyre/test/experiment1/ktir/<name>.ktir.mlir`, which the C++ toolchain
//! printed and `crate::text::parse` reads back so the two can be compared.
//!
//! # WHAT IS COMPARED
//!
//! `crate::text::diff`, field by field on the SSA graph: each op's kind, its attributes,
//! its result types, and the CANONICAL IDS of its operands -- so a rename is invisible and
//! a rewire is not -- in program order, recursing into regions. Plus the census, so a count
//! mismatch is reported even when the first positional difference would mask it.
//!
//! One bounded exception, which is that module's own and not this test's: a block's leading
//! `arith.constant`s are compared as a MULTISET, because MLIR's constant hoist order is
//! internal and matching it is not a claim a port can make from the outside. Value, type
//! and count are all still compared.
//!
//! # THE CONTROLS
//!
//! A green diff over a path this long could be a diff comparing nothing. So
//! `planted_*` break the converted module in each of the ways that matter and assert the
//! diff NAMES the field, and `refuses_*` assert the adapter's allow-lists refuse by name
//! rather than falling through -- the failure mode that has produced four latent defects in
//! this tree, each of them well-formed enough to look right.

/// fields — but THIS test's diff is stricter than that one (it also walks memory views, access-tile
/// corner operands and an op census), so the same decision surfaces here in more places. Every
/// signature below was MEASURED, and each is named separately so that a change in which ones appear
/// is itself visible.
///
/// ⛔⛔ AND THE C++ HAS **TWO** BEHAVIOURS FOR A TRANSPOSED DOT OPERAND, WHICH IS WHY THE LIST IS
/// NOT JUST THE OTHER TEST'S FOUR. Measured across the goldens:
///
///  * **the operand is a LOADED weight** (`swiglu_mlp_*`, `attention_flash_*`) — the C++ FOLDS the
///    transpose into the access tile, and in the SwiGLU goldens into the memory view as well, so no
///    `tt.trans` survives but the view/tile/load shapes are the post-transpose ones. Ours are the
///    shapes the kernel declares.
///  * **the operand is a COMPUTED value** (`decoder_*`, the RoPE'd K) — there is no access tile to
///    fold into, so the C++ LEAVES the `tt.trans` as an op. Ours is rewired past it and the trans is
///    dead, so `canonicalize` removes it.
///
/// The second case is why [`fold_dead_dot_transposes`] exists: this diff is POSITIONAL, so two ops
/// the golden has and we do not shift every later op by two and turn one decision into forty
/// `op kind differs` findings. Accepting those wholesale would be a blanket skip on the whole
/// decoder — exactly what must not happen — so the normaliser removes the CAUSE on both sides
/// instead, and what is left is diffed honestly.
///
/// ⛔⛔⛔ AND SINCE THE FIXTURES MOVED TO THE VALIDATED PAIRING, THIS PREDICATE COVERS **TWO** KINDS
/// OF THING. Stated here because they share a field signature and a reader would otherwise assume
/// one:
///
///  1. **A LOWERING DIVERGENCE** — the same kernel, and we spend the transpose somewhere else than
///     the C++ does. That is what the paragraphs above describe, and it is all this used to be.
///  2. **A FIXTURE THE GOLDEN NO LONGER DESCRIBES.** `test/fixtures/{swiglu_mlp,decoder_block}.py`
///     now present EVERY projection weight n-major with `.T` on the dot operand (swiglu delta 13,
///     decoder delta 8). The C++ goldens in `test/experiment1/ktir/` were generated from the
///     PREVIOUS fixtures and only IBM's C++ chain can regenerate them, so for the SwiGLU down
///     projection and the decoder's seven projections the golden describes a kernel whose weights
///     are presented the other way round.
///
/// MEASURED, as the finding counts moving and nothing else: `swiglu_mlp_small` 14 -> 21 (the down
/// projection's own six fields plus its `indexing_maps`), `swiglu_mlp_tiled_k` 10 -> 17,
/// `decoder_layer_one` 2 -> 43 and `decoder_two_layers` 4 -> 86. The residue stayed EMPTY throughout,
/// which is the check that the new differences really are the weight's axis order and not something
/// else the fixture edit disturbed.
///
/// ⚠ SO THIS ONE PREDICATE IS DOING A JOB IT SHOULD EVENTUALLY BE SPLIT OUT OF. Both kinds are "the
/// weight's axis order", which is why the fields coincide; they are not the same fact. The moment the
/// goldens can be regenerated from the current fixtures, (2) disappears and the counts should fall
/// back to roughly the pre-change figures — and `Expect::OnlyTheTransposedDotWeight`'s surprise arm
/// fires if any configuration becomes an exact match, so nobody has to remember to check.
///
/// ⛔ NARROW ON PURPOSE. Each clause is an AND of an op kind and a field. `op kind` and `op count`

        // defect. It also cannot be regenerated here: only IBM's C++ chain produces these files.

        // THE NEEDLE IS THE ROW ORDER'S OWN SIGNATURE IN THE CENSUS. Head-major needed a
        // TWO-AXIS grid and delinearized it -- `distribute_work` emits one `arith.divui` and one
        // `arith.remui` to split the linear work index into (block, head), which is where

        // configurations, alongside `arith.remui` and the `arith.addi` that summed the two terms.

        // sort first -- not because it is less load-bearing.

///
/// That module already compares a block's leading `arith.constant`s as a MULTISET, and its
/// header says why: MLIR's constant hoist order is internal, and matching it is not a claim
/// a port can make from the outside. `triton_frontend::opt::hoist_constants` reproduces the
/// move-to-front rule and gets it right for eleven of sixteen configurations, but the greedy
/// driver interleaves hoisting with folding on a worklist, so the last permutation of three
/// or four constants is not derivable.
///
/// WHAT MADE THAT INSUFFICIENT HERE. `DecomposeDenseConstants` turns each `dense<>` splat
/// into a scalar `arith.constant` plus a `tensor.splat`, so the permutation of the leading
/// constants becomes a permutation of `tensor.splat` OPS -- which the multiset exception
/// does not cover. Every SwiGLU configuration reported it as six findings: two swapped
/// splats, plus four knock-ons, because the diff refers to a value as "result of op K" and
/// so a permutation renumbers every reference.
///
/// WHY A `tensor.splat` BELONGS IN THE EXCEPTION. It is pure, and its only operand is a
/// constant that is itself in the leading run, so two splats of different constants are
/// independent of each other and their relative position is not a fact about the program.
///
/// WHAT IS STILL COMPARED, so this narrows nothing that matters: every constant's VALUE,

/// EVERY `linalg.matmul` WHOSE WEIGHT IS A **PRESENTED BUFFER** STATES THE TRANSPOSE-B MAPS.
///
/// ⭐ THIS IS THE INVARIANT THE FIXTURES WERE CHANGED TO ESTABLISH, AND IT NEEDS A TEST BECAUSE THE
/// FAILURE IS SILENT. An absent `indexing_maps` IS `linalg.matmul`'s default `[(d0,d2), (d2,d1),
/// (d0,d1)]`, i.e. W as `[k, n]`; nothing in `ktir-superdsc` reads the maps, so BOTH orientations
/// lower to the same descriptor and one of them computes the transposed contraction. Dropping a `.T`
/// from a fixture therefore yields a kernel that builds, bakes, and passes `dxp_standalone` while
/// computing the wrong projection. Only the KTIR says which orientation was meant, so only a test at
/// this level can hold it.
///
/// ⛔ AND **PRESENTED** IS THE LOAD-BEARING WORD, NOT A HEDGE. The maps LABEL which axis of B is `k`;
/// they do not MOVE a byte. `ktir-superdsc`'s kernel slot reads exactly one residency and it is
/// `[k, n]` (`StickLayout::kernel(k_in, n_out)`), so a transpose-B `[n, k]` operand's bytes have to be
/// placed by somebody — and for a presented weight that somebody is the HOST stage
/// (`stage_2d(&StickLayout::kernel(k, n), ..)`), once, at bake time. An IN-REGISTER COMPUTED value has
/// no host stage, no cache write, and nothing in that crate reads an access tile's `CoordinateOrder`,
/// so folding a `.T` of one into the maps DROPPED it: `decoder_block.py`'s `tl.dot(q1r, k1r.T)` and
/// `tl.dot(q2r, k2r.T)` contracted as `q1r @ k1r`, invisible to every extent guard because
/// `[M, HALF]` is 64x64 there. `dot_to_linalg` therefore folds ONLY when the transposed value is a
/// direct `tt.descriptor_load`, and this test is the two-sided statement of that rule.
///
/// ⛔ THE TWO EXCEPTIONS ARE NAMED, COUNTED, **AND DISCRIMINATED BY PROVENANCE** — a bare count
/// cannot tell them apart, and the difference between them is exactly the defect:
///
///  1. `a = tl.dot(p, v)` — a GENUINE plain-B dot. `v` is that kernel's own V-projection result, a
///     `[k, n]` tile, and `[k, n]` IS the slot's device order, so it is contracted where it lies (the
///     leg the shipped attention runs against its V cache at 41 tok/s). No `tt.trans` anywhere near
///     it. One per decoder layer.
///  2. the two SCORE matmuls — plain-B over a value a SURVIVING `tt.trans` produces. The `.T` is
///     still in the IR, `to_ktir::convert_trans` turns it into a real `linalg.transpose`, and the
///     plain `[k, n]` maps then read a buffer that is physically `[k, n]`. Two per decoder layer.
///
/// So an unmapped matmul is legitimate in exactly two shapes and the old silent drop is a THIRD:
/// unmapped, with a `.T` in the `.py` and no `tt.trans` left in the IR. That third shape is what the
/// per-operand checks below refuse, and no count alone would have seen it.
