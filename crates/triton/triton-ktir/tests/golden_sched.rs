//! STAGE 3: the port's `ToSchedulerKTIR` against the C++'s `3_sched.mlir`.
//!
//! Same discipline as `golden_ktir.rs` -- census first, then the structural diff field
//! by field, with the planted-difference control and golden-agrees-with-itself so
//! neither can pass while comparing nothing.
//!
//! WHICH FIXTURES HAVE A STAGE-3 GOLDEN: attention (both configurations) and the
//! unit-scale variant. `swiglu_mlp` has NONE, because the C++ chain refuses it one
//! stage earlier at `--spyre-lane-major-layout` ("this tile is 64 wide over a view 256
//! wide, so it is not a contiguous flat block"), and stage 3 runs on stage 2's output.
//! That refusal is asserted here so the absence is a measurement.
