//! THE ONE OP THE DECODER CONFIGURATIONS DIE ON, AND THE ONE PROPERTY THAT KILLS IT.
//!
//! # WHAT WAS MEASURED (dxp_standalone, deeptools `d3a9bf4`-era tree, 2026-09-18)
//!
//! `decoder_layer_one_flat` and `decoder_two_layers_flat` both BAKE (`ops=52`/`ops=104`) and both
//! refuse in `dxp_standalone` at `sdsc_22`, which is `transpose_o31` — a `[mb 64, out 64]` fp16
//! `interslicetranspose_fp16`. The refusal is arch-dependent and MOVES rather than clearing:
//!
//! ```text
//!   SENARCH=mpw4        exit 1  ddc/ddcv1.cpp:3414                "Implicit syncs not available
//!                                                                  for architectures prior to
//!                                                                  RCUDD1A"           (on sdsc_22)
//!   default = rcudd1a   exit 1  dsc-based-utils/DSC2ToDataflowIR/  "Translator currently supports
//!                               V3/SNComputeLowering.cpp:74         translating only 1-D dynamic
//!                                                                   masking"
//! ```
//!
//! (`DEFAULT_ISA = RCUDD1A_ISA`, `sys-arch-spec/isa/isa.hpp:31`, so unset ≡ `SENARCH=rcudd1a`;
//! `SENARCH=mpw4` → `MPW4_ISA`, `isa.cpp:1239-1240`.)
//!
//! ⭐ THE MECHANISM, FROM THE DEFINITIONS. `Ddc::transformForInterSliceRestickify`
//! (`ddc/ddc_transformation.cpp:2398`, called unconditionally from `Ddc::run_v1`,
//! `ddc/ddcv1.cpp:3764`) fires on any PT compute node whose INPUT stick order differs from its
//! OUTPUT stick order — every relayout — and then writes one mask offset per dim of
//! `compNode->getParentDimLoop(outputStickDimOrder[0])`
//! (`ddc_transformation.cpp:2383-2397`). `SNComputeLowering::constructDynamicMasking` accepts
//! exactly ONE loop node (`SNComputeLowering.cpp:68`) carrying exactly ONE dim (`:74`).
//!
//! ⛔⛔⛔ SO THE KILLING PROPERTY IS THE **TWO-DIM OUTPUT STICK**, not the shape and not the core
//! division. `interslicetranspose_fp16`'s output stick is the `8×8` inter-slice block over
//! (`out`, `mb`) — `emit_sdsc`'s `is_transpose_out` arm — so `getStickSizes(OUTPUT)` has two
//! entries, DDC takes `.at(0)` = `out`, and the innermost `out`-carrying loop of a 2-D
//! (`mb`, `out`) tile in this path is the FUSED `loop_dsX_dsY_out_mb` (dims `[mb, out]`, read out
//! of `debug/sdsc_*/sdsc.json` for every 2-D program of the same bundle). Two dims ⇒ `:74`.
//!
//! The restickify door does the SAME transposition with a ONE-dim output stick, DDC picks its
//! single-dim `loop_ds2_ds3_y`, and the same masked-MACC path is accepted — measured
//! `computeMaskLoopOffsets_ = {"0": {"loop_ds2_ds3_y": {"y": 1}}}` on eight
//! `compute_ptrowN_fma16_masked` nodes, exit 0, a 1456-line DataflowIR with
//! `dataflow.implicit_sync_on_streaming_buffer`.
//!
//! # WHAT THIS FILE ASSERTS, AND WHY THAT IS THE RIGHT ORACLE
//!
//! `cargo test` cannot run `dxp_standalone`. What it CAN pin is the one descriptor property the
//! refusal is a function of — the output stick's dim count — on both doors, so that a future change
//! to either one is a test failure that says "re-run the dxp leg" instead of a silent
//! re-introduction. The shape sweep is here because it was the discriminating control: all four
//! shapes refuse identically, including two whose core division splits BOTH axes like the golden
//! `ddc/ddl_templates/test/sdsc_interslicetranspose.json` (`{"out": 8, "mb": 4}`), which is what
//! ruled the division out.
//!
//! ⚖️ THAT SWEEP WAS MEASURED UNDER A DIFFERENT DIVIDER, and the shapes no longer all reach a
//! descriptor. `distribute_cores` now splits `mb` FIRST and to the hilt (`work.rs`'s flat-activation
//! row-mixing fix), so at `mb == 64` each of 32 cores gets 2 rows and `transpose_opspec`'s `[8, 8]`
//! block guard refuses before emission. The dxp measurement above STANDS as the reason the division
//! was ruled out — it was taken when those shapes did divide like the golden — but it is history, not
//! something this file can still reproduce. The sweep therefore records each shape as
//! refused-by-division or emitted-with-a-two-dim-stick, and asserts that at least one still emits so
//! the discriminating assertion cannot pass vacuously.
//!
//! # ⭐⭐⭐ WHAT THE REROUTE MEASURED, END TO END (2026-09-24)
//!
//! Both decoder configurations now BAKE and both COMPILE THROUGH dxp at the default RCUDD1A arch —
//! the leg the transpose door could not pass:
//!
//! ```text
//!   decoder_layer_one_flat    KTIR_WHOLE=1 bake  ops=52   files=53
//!   decoder_two_layers_flat   KTIR_WHOLE=1 bake  ops=104  files=105
//!   dxp_standalone --bundle -d <dir> -b sentient        RC=0 for BOTH, spyreCodeDir/ written
//! ```
//!
//! The two relayouts are `sdsc_22.json`/`sdsc_24.json` (`22_transpose_o31`, `24_transpose_o33`), and
//! the descriptor dxp accepted is the one [`the_rerouted_ktir_door_transposes_with_a_one_dim_output_stick_at_every_shape`]
//! pins:
//!
//! ```text
//!   INPUT   layoutDimOrder_ ["y","out"]  stickDimOrder_ ["out"]  stickSize_ [64]
//!   OUTPUT  layoutDimOrder_ ["out","y"]  stickDimOrder_ ["y"]    stickSize_ [64]
//!   computeOp_  exUnit "sfp"  opFuncName "ReStickifyOpHBM"       numCoresUsed_ 1
//! ```
//!
//! ⛔ TWO SEPARATE GAPS BLOCKED THESE CONFIGURATIONS, and the transpose was only the first. Once it
//! was rerouted the walk refused on the SOFTMAX instead: `Elementwise(Sub)` over a `[64, 1]` per-row
//! max, which `pointwise_extents_agree` correctly refuses because the seeded whole-tensor builder
//! addresses every operand at the OUTPUT's extent. That is now emitted through the `EwOperand`
//! builders the refusal itself names — see `lower_ktir_to_superdsc::elementwise_broadcast`, whose own
//! probes (the accepting `Col`/`Mb` arms and the three refusals around them) live beside it in that
//! module's test block.
//!
//! ⛔ NOTHING HERE LOOSENS A GUARD. `try_assemble_transpose` is called in its fallible form, so a
//! shape its core-division law refuses is RECORDED as refused, not forced through.
//!
//! # RE-RUNNING THE dxp LEG
//!
//! ```bash
//! TRANSPOSE_PROBE_DIR=/tmp/trprobe cargo test --offline --test transpose_shape_probe -- --nocapture
//! export DEEPTOOLS_PATH=<a deeptools checkout>   # $DEEPTOOLS_PATH/ddc/ddl_templates/ is read
//! for d in /tmp/trprobe/*/; do
//!   rm -rf /tmp/r && cp -R "$d" /tmp/r            # dxp WRITES into its input dir
//!   dxp_standalone -d /tmp/r -b sentient; echo "$d -> $?"
//! done
//! ```
//!
//! ⛔ `inter_slice_transpose.ddl` IS NOT IN THE INSTALLED TOOLCHAIN. It and
//! `inter_slice_transpose_with_bottomdatastage.ddl` are the only two `.ddl` in
//! `ddc/ddl_templates/` that `DDL_TEMPLATES` (that directory's `CMakeLists.txt:8-32`) does not
//! list, and the install/obfuscate rules iterate that list alone (`:59-72`) — so a run against an
//! INSTALL rather than a source checkout dies earlier, on a missing template.
