//! ⛔⛔⛔ THE WHOLE-FUNCTION DOOR DROPS A `linalg.matmul`'s THIRD OPERAND, UNREAD AND UNDIAGNOSED —
//! AND FLASH ATTENTION'S OUTPUT ACCUMULATOR IS THAT OPERAND.
//!
//! # WHAT THIS MEASURES
//!
//! `linalg.matmul(A, B, C)` computes `C + A·B`: the third operand is the DPS init, and for a
//! zero-init it carries no data. `emit::whole_function::lower_function` encodes that reading as a
//! CONSTANT:
//!
//! ```text
//!   whole_function.rs:1376   let n_in = match program { ... Lowering::Node(Program::Matmul) => 2, ... }
//!   whole_function.rs:1410   (None, None) => op.operands.iter().copied().take(n_in).collect(),
//! ```
//!
//! and operand 2 is then read by NOTHING: `grep -n 'operands.get(2)\|operands\[2\]'` over
//! `whole_function.rs` is empty, and `matmul_b_orientation` reads only the `indexing_maps`
//! attribute. So a matmul whose `outs` is a LIVE VALUE lowers to the same descriptor as one whose
//! `outs` is zero — the running sum is discarded with no refusal.
//!
//! ⭐ THAT IS EXACTLY FLASH ATTENTION'S `P·V` LEG. From `KTIR_DUMP=1` on
//! `attention_flash_causal` (`KTIR_WHOLE=1 bake_py`), inside the KV loop:
//!
//! ```text
//!   %682 = ArithMulf(%650, %681)              acc * alpha[:, None]      [64, 128]
//!   %686 = LinalgMatmul(%673, %684, %682)     tl.dot(p, v, acc)         [64, 128]
//!   ScfYield(%686, %688, %665, %699, %710)    acc, l_i, m_i, k_off, v_off
//! ```
//!
//! `%682` is the rescaled running output — the flash recurrence's whole state. Dropping it makes the
//! emitted program compute `p·v` for ONE trip and discard every earlier trip's contribution.
//!
//! # WHY NO EXISTING GUARD CATCHES IT
//!
//! `triton-ktir`'s `dot_to_linalg` DOES guard the accumulator — "matmul accumulator is not
//! zero-initialized (a bias/fused init would be dropped)", `dot_to_linalg.rs:391` — but only from
//! `verify_canonical_matmul_kernel`, which `run()` calls under `if single_dot_kernel`
//! (`dot_to_linalg.rs:146`), i.e. only when the module holds EXACTLY ONE `tt.dot`. Attention holds
//! two per `_attn_fwd_inner` call (the score matmul and `P·V`), so `dots.len() != 1`, `canonical`
//! is `false`, and those guards never run. Nothing else in either crate reads a matmul's operand 2.
//!
//! ⭐ AND THE IR HAS A CHANNEL FOR THE FACT. `ktir_core::attrkey::AttrKey` carries `NIns` and
//! `OutsVar` — a producer-stated input arity and outs variable, which `triton-ktir`'s
//! `to_ktir_emit.rs:416-418` already translates from source text. `grep -rn 'NIns\|OutsVar'` over
//! `ktir-superdsc/src` is EMPTY: the door hardcodes 2 instead of reading what the producer states.
//! So this is an UNREAD ATTRIBUTE, not a missing IR capability.
//!
//! # ⛔⛔⛔ AND IT IS **NOT** LATENT — A CONFIGURATION RECORDED AS WORKING IS ALREADY WRONG
//!
//! The first draft of this module said the drop was latent behind the `regions` refusal, so "no
//! baked descriptor is wrong TODAY". **THAT WAS FALSE, and this measurement is what falsified it.**
//! Attention indeed cannot reach this door (`regions` refuses its in-loop `desc_k` windows first) —
//! but attention is not the only kernel with a real accumulation.
//!
//! `decoder_block.py:274-275` splits the score matmul over the head dimension in two pieces, in
//! STRAIGHT-LINE code with no loop at all:
//!
//! ```python
//!   qk = tl.dot(q1r, k1r.T, out_dtype=tl.float16)
//!   qk = tl.dot(q2r, k2r.T, qk)          # accumulates onto the first half
//! ```
//!
//! MEASURED on `decoder_layer_one_flat` (`KTIR_WHOLE=1 bake_py`, which BAKES: `ops=52 files=53`,
//! and is recorded passing `dxp_standalone --bundle -b sentient` with RC=0):
//!
//! ```text
//!   KTIR      %447 = LinalgMatmul(%434, %444, %403)    q1r·k1rᵀ, outs = a zero splat
//!             %450 = LinalgMatmul(%437, %448, %447)    q2r·k2rᵀ, outs = %447   ⛔
//!             %454 = ArithMulf(%450, %453)             qk * QK_SCALE
//!   %447's USES: exactly one — operand 2 of %450. Nothing else.
//!
//!   EMITTED   23_matmul_o32     writes t32   (q1r·k1rᵀ)
//!             25_matmul_o34     writes t34   (q2r·k2rᵀ)
//!             26_scalarmul_o35  reads  t34
//!   and NO op among the 52 combines t32 with t34.
//! ```
//!
//! So `t32` is written and never read: the baked bundle computes its attention scores as
//! `q2r·k2rᵀ` ALONE, discarding half the head dimension's contribution — while baking clean and
//! compiling through dxp. `decoder_two_layers_flat` (`ops=104`) carries the same defect twice.
//!
//! ⚖️ WHAT IS **NOT** ESTABLISHED. No card number was taken for the decoder against its own
//! `test/numeric/decoder_layer_one_flat/ref_out.bin` (a torch reference exists, generated
//! 2026-09-18; `meta.json` records no run). The argument above is an ARTIFACT-level proof — a
//! written-and-never-read buffer plus a measured operand drop — not a scored divergence. A pod run
//! against that reference is the confirming measurement and has not been done.
//!
//! ⛔ NOTHING HERE LOOSENS A GUARD. The probe only ASSERTS what the door does; it changes no
//! vendored code. The fix belongs upstream — see the report accompanying this file.
