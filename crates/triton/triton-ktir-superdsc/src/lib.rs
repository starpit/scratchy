//! ADAPTER: our KTIR value -> `ktir-superdsc`'s request type and per-kind entry points.
//!
//! # WHAT THIS IS AND IS NOT
//!
//! It is NOT a lowering. Every descriptor decision belongs to `ktir-superdsc`, whose output is
//! validated by byte-identity against a bake proven on silicon. This crate's whole job is to
//! present our KTIR in the shape that crate's door takes:
//!
//! ```text
//!   our Module --(triton_ktir::handoff)--> ktir_core::IRFunction
//!                                              |
//!                                              +--> KtirNode { func, program, bindings, ... }
//!                                                        |
//!                                                        +--> emit::{rmsnorm, attn_at, ...}
//! ```
//!
//! # THE FIVE FIELDS, AND WHICH ARE HARD
//!
//! `KtirNode` is `{ func, program, bindings, mask, node_out_tid }`. Four are mechanical:
//!
//! * `func` — [`triton_ktir::handoff::lower`] already builds it. Their type wants `'static`, so
//!   the arena is [`ktir_core::arena::Arena::global`].
//! * `bindings` — a `BufferId` per parameter, in order. Their crate treats these as opaque keys
//!   and never asks what a buffer is, so parameter position IS the numbering.
//! * `mask` / `node_out_tid` — `None` for everything we emit today.
//!
//! **`program` is the one that is not mechanical**, and it is the whole open question:
//! [`Program`] names what a program COMPUTES (`RmsNorm`, `Attn`, `Matmul`,
//! `Elementwise(Silu)`, …). Their producer knows it because it built the node from a tape.
//! We have to say it about a Triton kernel.
//!
//! # WHY THAT IS NOT AUTOMATICALLY A "RECOGNIZER"
//!
//! Their `Program` doc says the kind "is NOT derivable … a pointwise KTIR body is the same
//! op-DAG shape whichever function it applies". That is true of THEIR producer's KTIR and
//! false of ours: we emit `arith.addf` where an add is meant and `arith.mulf` where a multiply
//! is, so `Elementwise(Add)` is a 1:1 op mapping, not pattern matching.
//!
//! The fused kinds are the real question, and there are two honest answers — the choice is the
//! owner's, not this crate's:
//!
//! 1. **Source provenance.** Triton names these things: a `@triton.jit` helper called `rmsnorm`,
//!    a `tl.sigmoid` call the frontend sees BEFORE inlining, the kernel's own name. Carried as
//!    an attribute, the kind is a fact the PROGRAMMER stated -- not one the compiler inferred.
//! 2. **Structural matching.** Recognise the silu longhand, the rmsnorm shape, the online
//!    softmax. This is what "no kernel recognizers, no algorithm names in the compiler" rules
//!    out, and it is fragile in exactly the way that constraint anticipates.
//!
//! Until that is settled, [`drive`] takes the `Program` as an ARGUMENT. The driver states it per
//! fixture, so bring-up is not blocked on the design decision and no classifier is smuggled in
//! by accident.

//  THE MODEL-GEOMETRY CONST DOOR
//
//  `rope_at::<HD>` and `attn_at::<NQH, NKVH, HD>` are const-generic because the head geometry
//  parameterises the DEVICE layout — GQA grouping, slabs, head strides — so a branch on it is a
//  branch on a const the compiler can hold onto (`rope_at`'s own doc: "the collapsed RoPE form and
//  the slab RoPE form become TWO INSTANTIATIONS rather than two arms of one function"). A runtime
//  `Program` cannot reach them; something has to name the triple.
//
//  ⛔ THE VALUES ARE THE FIXTURE'S OWN `tl.constexpr`, READ, NEVER DEFAULTED. `HEAD_DIM`, `H` and
//  `GQA` are constexpr parameters of the kernels themselves (`attention_flash.py` line 339-343,
//  `rope.py` line 132-135) and are recorded per configuration in
//  `test/experiment1/index.json`'s `constexprs`, which `run_experiment1.py` fills from the
//  fixture's own `constexprs()` (line 174/223, `constexprs=ce`). A DEFAULT here would be a wrong
//  GQA grouping — every query head reading the wrong kv plane — with nothing to catch it, so the
//  driver refuses a configuration whose keys it cannot read.
//
//  ⛔ AND `GQA` IS THE GROUPING, NOT THE KV HEAD COUNT. `attention_flash.py`: "a query head reads
//  the kv plane it shares, `off_h // GQA`" and "the kv planes are nkvh-deduped, so their descriptor
//  extent is `H // GQA` planes". So NQH = H and NKVH = H / GQA — the division is the whole point,
//  and inverting it is exactly the silent mis-grouping the const door exists to make visible.

//  high-water, because the leg's HBM FETCH over-reads the ids by up to one 128-B granule and a
//  segment boundary is not a place that over-read can land.
//
//  MEASURED ON CARD (`paged_score_small`, rung 4): the ids were the segment's last placement,
//  ended exactly at `segment_bytes[3]`, and the fetch of the final 128-B stick faulted
//  (`HMI=FETCH addr=0xc00004480`, `run_prefix_only sync rc=-1`). ONE GRANULE of slack past the
//  high-water (17664→17792) made the identical bundle run clean with byte-identical output, and
//  the fault is scoped, not general: the embedding configs run card-verified with their ids at
//  offset 0 (never flush — a neighbour above absorbs the over-read), and attention's flush-at-end
//  OUTPUT writes clean — it is the gather's fetch path alone that pays this.
