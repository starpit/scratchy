//! DISCRIMINATING CONTROLS: wrong-but-plausible algorithms, and the bracketing control.
//!
//! A tolerance that nothing can fail is not a test. Each mutant here is a WRONG algorithm a
//! plausible bug would produce, and the harness asserts each one EXCEEDS the envelope its true
//! counterpart sits inside. Ported from `third_party/spyre/test/pod/*_oracle2.py` and
//! `*_negctl.py`; the five configs with no pod ancestor (rope x2, embedding x2, decoder x2 —
//! authored here) are marked AUTHORED in their module docs.
//!
//! TWO THINGS THIS FILE REFUSES TO DO, both of them lessons from the pod apparatus:
//!
//!   1. IT DOES NOT HIDE A CONTROL THAT CANNOT DISCRIMINATE. `rmsnorm_oracle2.py:21-24` reports
//!      "the full 64-stick partition HONESTLY: some sticks carry so little energy that omitting
//!      them rounds away below one DL16 ULP (a sub-ULP no-op, numerically undetectable)". The port
//!      of that honesty is [`rmsnorm::stick_drop_materiality`], which returns the material and
//!      immaterial counts so a caller can NAME the weak controls instead of quietly dropping them.
//!      A mutant that cannot exceed the bound is a fact about the bound, not a bug to be tidied.
//!
//!   2. IT DOES NOT PRETEND A ONE-SIDED CONTROL PROVES A THRESHOLD. [`bracket`] is the whole point
//!      of the file: `1.5x` the per-element bound must FAIL and `0.5x` must PASS. A one-sided
//!      control only shows the gate CAN fire; bracketing shows it fires exactly where the
//!      derivation puts it (`fp_negctl.py:13-19`, `swiglu_negctl.py:10-13`).
//!
//! Everything here is a pure function over `f64` slices: no emulator, no IR, no files. The
//! reference builders take the same inputs as their `truth` counterpart and return the MUTANT's
//! output, so a test asserts `env.contains(truth_i, mutant_i)` is false somewhere.
