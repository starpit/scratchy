//! asserted:
//!
//!   * [`Expect::Matches`] -- compiles AND agrees with its `.ttir_raw.mlir` golden
//!     structurally, field by field.
//!   * [`Expect::RefusedContaining`] -- does NOT compile, and the refusal message contains
//!     the given text. This is the FAIL-CLOSED half: an unimplemented construct must
//!     produce a named error, never a partial module that looks plausible. A fixture that
//!     starts compiling will fail this test and force the status to be updated with a
//!     golden diff, which is the point.
//!
//! `cargo test --features ruff --test fixture_status -- --nocapture` prints the mismatches.
