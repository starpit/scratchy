"""Emit each types sub-campaign's port.json and review.json from UNITS.tsv + the vendored headers.

⛔ WHY THIS EXISTS RATHER THAN `wavefront schedule`. The oracle's CodeQL database is built and its T1
entity tables are complete, but THREE T2 edge tables were never extracted by the older tool version
(`macro_expansions`, `macro_generated_types`, `signature_type_uses`), and `compose/reach.py` loads
`macro_expansions.csv` unconditionally. Re-extracting it is an unfiltered `from MacroInvocation mi,
Macro m` over a 56 GB C++ database. If that extraction lands, PREFER `wavefront schedule` and diff its
layering against this file's — a disagreement is a real finding about the type graph, not a nuisance.

⛔ WHAT THIS SCRIPT DOES **NOT** INVENT. Every number below is read from a file:
  - the unit list, levels, callees and homes come from crustify-types/UNITS.tsv;
  - the field names and class spans are re-derived from crustify-types/cpp/*.h on every run, so the
    schedule cannot drift from the authority (those headers are byte-identical to deeptools-src
    @ a0d29abbed, verified with `cmp` at staging).
The only authored inputs are the batching budgets, which match the capacity campaign's.

⛔ AND THE LEVELS IN UNITS.tsv WERE MEASURED, NOT GUESSED. Three edges an earlier draft asserted were
counted and found to be ZERO: DesignSpaceConfig->Metadata, Metadata->FailedAlloc,
ScheduleTree->BlockNode. If you add a unit, count its edges in the class body before assigning a level.
