# ⭐ THE CI-ONLY SIBLING: a minimal senlib-rs checkout, synthesized where the real one
# cannot reach. `backends/spyre-hw` resolves `flex-rs` by path into a sibling senlib-rs
# checkout, and cargo loads every workspace member's dependencies' manifests — optional
# ones included — so even the emulator-only `spyre` build and a plain `cargo metadata`
# refuse to resolve without that sibling. The real checkout lives on IBM-internal git
# (a card host fact); this script writes the smallest tree that satisfies resolution:
# the flex-rs manifest with the one feature this workspace names (`snt1p0`), over an
# EMPTY lib.
#
# That emptiness is the guard, not a gap: every CI step that only RESOLVES the card
# workspace (the emulator clippy and tests, the `spyre` binary's targets, `cargo
# metadata`, `cargo fmt`) runs against the stub, and any step that would COMPILE
# flex-rs fails loudly on its unresolved imports instead of passing against a hollow
# crate. The steps that must compile flex-rs (the card-surface clippy, the worker's
# card path, the card crate's compile_fail doctests) are scripts/spyre-hw-card-gate.sh,
# run on a card host beside the real checkout — never here.
#
# Idempotent: rewrites the same bytes, so a job may call it before any step.
